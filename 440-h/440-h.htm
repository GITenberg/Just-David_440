CHAPTER I
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
THE MOUNTAIN HOME
</H3>

<P>
Far up on the mountain-side the little shack stood alone in the clearing. It was roughly
yet warmly built. Behind it jagged cliffs broke the north wind, and
towered gray-white in the sunshine. Before it a tiny expanse of green
sloped gently away to a point where the mountain dropped in another
sharp descent, wooded with scrubby firs and pines. At the left a
footpath led into the cool depths of the forest. But at the right the
mountain fell away again and disclosed to view the picture David loved
the best of all: the far-reaching valley; the silver pool of the lake
with its ribbon of a river flung far out; and above it the grays and
greens and purples of the mountains that climbed one upon another's
shoulders until the topmost thrust their heads into the wide dome of
the sky itself.
</P>

<P>
There was no road, apparently, leading away from the cabin. There was
only the footpath that disappeared into the forest. Neither, anywhere,
was there a house in sight nearer than the white specks far down in the
valley by the river.
</P>

<P>
Within the shack a wide fireplace dominated one side of the main room.
It was June now, and the ashes lay cold on the hearth; but from the
tiny lean-to in the rear came the smell and the sputter of bacon
sizzling over a blaze. The furnishings of the room were simple, yet, in
a way, out of the common. There were two bunks, a few rude but
comfortable chairs, a table, two music-racks, two violins with their
cases, and everywhere books, and scattered sheets of music. Nowhere was
there cushion, curtain, or knickknack that told of a woman's taste or
touch. On the other hand, neither was there anywhere gun, pelt, or
antlered head that spoke of a man's strength and skill. For decoration
there were a beautiful copy of the Sistine Madonna, several photographs
signed with names well known out in the great world beyond the
mountains, and a festoon of pine cones such as a child might gather and
hang.
</P>

<P>
From the little lean-to kitchen the sound of the sputtering suddenly
ceased, and at the door appeared a pair of dark, wistful eyes.
</P>

<P>
"Daddy!" called the owner of the eyes.
</P>

<P>
There was no answer.
</P>

<P>
"Father, are you there?" called the voice, more insistently.
</P>

<P>
From one of the bunks came a slight stir and a murmured word. At the
sound the boy at the door leaped softly into the room and hurried to
the bunk in the corner. He was a slender lad with short, crisp curls at
his ears, and the red of perfect health in his cheeks. His hands, slim,
long, and with tapering fingers like a girl's, reached forward eagerly.
</P>

<P>
"Daddy, come! I've done the bacon all myself, and the potatoes and the
coffee, too. Quick, it's all getting cold!"
</P>

<P>
Slowly, with the aid of the boy's firm hands, the man pulled himself
half to a sitting posture. His cheeks, like the boy's, were red&mdash;but
not with health. His eyes were a little wild, but his voice was low and
very tender, like a caress.
</P>

<P>
"David&mdash;it's my little son David!"
</P>

<P>
"Of course it's David! Who else should it be?" laughed the boy. "Come!"
And he tugged at the man's hands.
</P>

<P>
The man rose then, unsteadily, and by sheer will forced himself to
stand upright. The wild look left his eyes, and the flush his cheeks.
His face looked suddenly old and haggard. Yet with fairly sure steps he
crossed the room and entered the little kitchen.
</P>

<P>
Half of the bacon was black; the other half was transparent and like
tough jelly. The potatoes were soggy, and had the unmistakable taste
that comes from a dish that has boiled dry. The coffee was lukewarm and
muddy. Even the milk was sour.
</P>

<P>
David laughed a little ruefully.
</P>

<P>
"Things aren't so nice as yours, father," he apologized. "I'm afraid
I'm nothing but a discord in that orchestra to-day! Somehow, some of
the stove was hotter than the rest, and burnt up the bacon in spots;
and all the water got out of the potatoes, too,&mdash;though THAT didn't
matter, for I just put more cold in. I forgot and left the milk in the
sun, and it tastes bad now; but I'm sure next time it'll be better&mdash;all
of it."
</P>

<P>
The man smiled, but he shook his head sadly.
</P>

<P>
"But there ought not to be any 'next time,' David."
</P>

<P>
"Why not? What do you mean? Aren't you ever going to let me try again,
father?" There was real distress in the boy's voice.
</P>

<P>
The man hesitated. His lips parted with an indrawn breath, as if behind
them lay a rush of words. But they closed abruptly, the words still
unsaid. Then, very lightly, came these others:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"Well, son, this isn't a very nice way to treat your supper, is it?
Now, if you please, I'll take some of that bacon. I think I feel my
appetite coming back."
</P>

<P>
If the truant appetite "came back," however, it could not have stayed;
for the man ate but little. He frowned, too, as he saw how little the
boy ate. He sat silent while his son cleared the food and dishes away,
and he was still silent when, with the boy, he passed out of the house
and walked to the little bench facing the west.
</P>

<P>
Unless it stormed very hard, David never went to bed without this last
look at his "Silver Lake," as he called the little sheet of water far
down in the valley.
</P>

<P>
"Daddy, it's gold to-night&mdash;all gold with the sun!" he cried
rapturously, as his eyes fell upon his treasure. "Oh, daddy!"
</P>

<P>
It was a long-drawn cry of ecstasy, and hearing it, the man winced, as
with sudden pain.
</P>

<P>
"Daddy, I'm going to play it&mdash;I've got to play it!" cried the boy,
bounding toward the cabin. In a moment he had returned, violin at his
chin.
</P>

<P>
The man watched and listened; and as he watched and listened, his face
became a battle-ground whereon pride and fear, hope and despair, joy
and sorrow, fought for the mastery.
</P>

<P>
It was no new thing for David to "play" the sunset. Always, when he was
moved, David turned to his violin. Always in its quivering strings he
found the means to say that which his tongue could not express.
</P>

<P>
Across the valley the grays and blues of the mountains had become all
purples now. Above, the sky in one vast flame of crimson and gold, was
a molten sea on which floated rose-pink cloud-boats. Below, the valley
with its lake and river picked out in rose and gold against the shadowy
greens of field and forest, seemed like some enchanted fairyland of
loveliness.
</P>

<P>
And all this was in David's violin, and all this, too, was on David's
uplifted, rapturous face.
</P>

<P>
As the last rose-glow turned to gray and the last strain quivered into
silence, the man spoke. His voice was almost harsh with self-control.
</P>

<P>
"David, the time has come. We'll have to give it up&mdash;you and I."
</P>

<P>
The boy turned wonderingly, his face still softly luminous.
</P>

<P>
"Give what up?"
</P>

<P>
"This&mdash;all this."
</P>

<P>
"This! Why, father, what do you mean? This is home!"
</P>

<P>
The man nodded wearily.
</P>

<P>
"I know. It has been home; but, David, you didn't think we could always
live here, like this, did you?"
</P>

<P>
David laughed softly, and turned his eyes once more to the distant
sky-line.
</P>

<P>
"Why not?" he asked dreamily. "What better place could there be? I like
it, daddy."
</P>

<P>
The man drew a troubled breath, and stirred restlessly. The teasing
pain in his side was very bad to-night, and no change of position eased
it.  He was ill, very ill; and he knew it.  Yet he also knew that, to
David, sickness, pain, and death meant nothing&mdash;or, at most, words that
had always been lightly, almost unconsciously passed over. For the
first time he wondered if, after all, his training&mdash;some of it&mdash;had
been wise.
</P>

<P>
For six years he had had the boy under his exclusive care and guidance.
For six years the boy had eaten the food, worn the clothing, and
studied the books of his father's choosing. For six years that father
had thought, planned, breathed, moved, lived for his son. There had
been no others in the little cabin. There had been only the occasional
trips through the woods to the little town on the mountain-side for
food and clothing, to break the days of close companionship.
</P>

<P>
All this the man had planned carefully. He had meant that only the good
and beautiful should have place in David's youth. It was not that he
intended that evil, unhappiness, and death should lack definition, only
definiteness, in the boy's mind. It should be a case where the good and
the beautiful should so fill the thoughts that there would be no room
for anything else. This had been his plan. And thus far he had
succeeded&mdash;succeeded so wonderfully that he began now, in the face of
his own illness, and of what he feared would come of it, to doubt the
wisdom of that planning.
</P>

<P>
As he looked at the boy's rapt face, he remembered David's surprised
questioning at the first dead squirrel he had found in the woods. David
was six then.
</P>

<P>
"Why, daddy, he's asleep, and he won't wake up!" he had cried. Then,
after a gentle touch: "And he's cold&mdash;oh, so cold!"
</P>

<P>
The father had hurried his son away at the time, and had evaded his
questions; and David had seemed content. But the next day the boy had
gone back to the subject. His eyes were wide then, and a little
frightened.
</P>

<P>
"Father, what is it to be&mdash;dead?"
</P>

<P>
"What do you mean, David?"
</P>

<P>
"The boy who brings the milk&mdash;he had the squirrel this morning. He said
it was not asleep. It was&mdash;dead."
</P>

<P>
"It means that the squirrel, the real squirrel under the fur, has gone
away, David."
</P>

<P>
"Where?"
</P>

<P>
"To a far country, perhaps."
</P>

<P>
"Will he come back?"
</P>

<P>
"No."
</P>

<P>
"Did he want to go?"
</P>

<P>
"We'll hope so."
</P>

<P>
"But he left his&mdash;his fur coat behind him. Didn't he need&mdash;that?"
</P>

<P>
"No, or he'd have taken it with him."
</P>

<P>
David had fallen silent at this. He had remained strangely silent
indeed for some days; then, out in the woods with his father one
morning, he gave a joyous shout. He was standing by the ice-covered
brook, and looking at a little black hole through which the hurrying
water could be plainly seen.
</P>

<P>
"Daddy, oh, daddy, I know now how it is, about being&mdash;dead."
</P>

<P>
"Why&mdash;David!"
</P>

<P>
"It's like the water in the brook, you know; THAT'S going to a far
country, and it isn't coming back. And it leaves its little cold
ice-coat behind it just as the squirrel did, too. It does n't need it.
It can go without it. Don't you see? And it's singing&mdash;listen!&mdash;it's
singing as it goes. It WANTS to go!"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, David." And David's father had sighed with relief that his son
had found his own explanation of the mystery, and one that satisfied.
</P>

<P>
Later, in his books, David found death again. It was a man, this time.
The boy had looked up with startled eyes.
</P>

<P>
"Do people, real people, like you and me, be dead, father? Do they go
to a far country?
</P>

<P>
"Yes, son in time&mdash;to a far country ruled over by a great and good King
they tell us."
</P>

<P>
David's father had trembled as he said it, and had waited fearfully for
the result. But David had only smiled happily as he answered:
</P>

<P>
"But they go singing, father, like the little brook. You know I heard
it!"
</P>

<P>
And there the matter had ended. David was ten now, and not yet for him
did death spell terror. Because of this David's father was relieved;
and yet&mdash;still because of this&mdash;he was afraid.
</P>

<P>
"David," he said gently. "Listen to me."
</P>

<P>
The boy turned with a long sigh.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, father."
</P>

<P>
"We must go away. Out in the great world there are men and women and
children waiting for you. You've a beautiful work to do; and one can't
do one's work on a mountain-top."
</P>

<P>
"Why not? I like it here, and I've always been here."
</P>

<P>
"Not always, David; six years. You were four when I brought you here.
You don't remember, perhaps."
</P>

<P>
David shook his head. His eyes were again dreamily fixed on the sky.
</P>

<P>
"I think I'd like it&mdash;to go&mdash;if I could sail away on that little
cloud-boat up there," he murmured.
</P>

<P>
The man sighed and shook his head.
</P>

<P>
"We can't go on cloud-boats. We must walk, David, for a way&mdash;and we
must go soon&mdash;soon," he added feverishly. "I must get you back&mdash;back
among friends, before&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
He rose unsteadily, and tried to walk erect. His limbs shook, and the
blood throbbed at his temples. He was appalled at his weakness. With a
fierceness born of his terror he turned sharply to the boy at his side.
</P>

<P>
"David, we've got to go! We've got to go&mdash;TO-MORROW!"
</P>

<P>
"Father!"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, yes, come!" He stumbled blindly, yet in some way he reached the
cabin door.
</P>

<P>
Behind him David still sat, inert, staring. The next minute the boy had
sprung to his feet and was hurrying after his father.

CHAPTER II
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
THE TRAIL
</H3>

<P>
A curious strength seemed to have come to the man. With almost steady
hands he took down the photographs and the Sistine Madonna, packing
them neatly away in a box to be left. From beneath his bunk he dragged
a large, dusty traveling-bag, and in this he stowed a little food, a
few garments, and a great deal of the music scattered about the room.
</P>

<P>
David, in the doorway, stared in dazed wonder. Gradually into his eyes
crept a look never seen there before.
</P>

<P>
"Father, where are we going?" he asked at last in a shaking voice, as
he came slowly into the room.
</P>

<P>
"Back, son; we're going back."
</P>

<P>
"To the village, where we get our eggs and bacon?"
</P>

<P>
"No, no, lad, not there. The other way. We go down into the valley this
time."
</P>

<P>
"The valley&mdash;MY valley, with the Silver Lake?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, my son; and beyond&mdash;far beyond." The man spoke dreamily. He was
looking at a photograph in his hand. It had slipped in among the loose
sheets of music, and had not been put away with the others. It was the
likeness of a beautiful woman.
</P>

<P>
For a moment David eyed him uncertainly; then he spoke.
</P>

<P>
"Daddy, who is that? Who are all these people in the pictures? You've
never told me about any of them except the little round one that you
wear in your pocket. Who are they?"
</P>

<P>
Instead of answering, the man turned faraway eyes on the boy and smiled
wistfully.
</P>

<P>
"Ah, David, lad, how they'll love you! How they will love you! But you
mustn't let them spoil you, son. You must remember&mdash;remember all I've
told you."
</P>

<P>
Once again David asked his question, but this time the man only turned
back to the photograph, muttering something the boy could not
understand.
</P>

<P>
After that David did not question any more. He was too amazed, too
distressed. He had never before seen his father like this. With nervous
haste the man was setting the little room to rights, crowding things
into the bag, and packing other things away in an old trunk. His cheeks
were very red, and his eyes very bright. He talked, too, almost
constantly, though David could understand scarcely a word of what was
said. Later, the man caught up his violin and played; and never before
had David heard his father play like that. The boy's eyes filled, and
his heart ached with a pain that choked and numbed&mdash;though why, David
could not have told. Still later, the man dropped his violin and sank
exhausted into a chair; and then David, worn and frightened with it
all, crept to his bunk and fell asleep.

<P>
In the gray dawn of the morning David awoke to a different world. His
father, white-faced and gentle, was calling him to get ready for
breakfast. The little room, dismantled of its decorations, was bare and
cold. The bag, closed and strapped, rested on the floor by the door,
together with the two violins in their cases, ready to carry.
</P>

<P>
"We must hurry, son. It's a long tramp before we take the cars."
</P>

<P>
"The cars&mdash;the real cars? Do we go in those?" David was fully awake now.
</P>

<P>
"Yes."
</P>

<P>
"And is that all we're to carry?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes. Hurry, son."
</P>

<P>
"But we come back&mdash;sometime?"
</P>

<P>
There was no answer.
</P>

<P>
"Father, we're coming back&mdash;sometime?" David's voice was insistent now.
</P>

<P>
The man stooped and tightened a strap that was already quite tight
enough. Then he laughed lightly.
</P>

<P>
"Why, of course you're coming back sometime, David. Only think of all
these things we're leaving!"
</P>

<P>
When the last dish was put away, the last garment adjusted, and the
last look given to the little room, the travelers picked up the bag and
the violins, and went out into the sweet freshness of the morning. As
he fastened the door the man sighed profoundly; but David did not
notice this. His face was turned toward the east&mdash;always David looked
toward the sun.
</P>

<P>
"Daddy, let's not go, after all! Let's stay here," he cried ardently,
drinking in the beauty of the morning.
</P>

<P>
"We must go, David. Come, son." And the man led the way across the
green slope to the west.
</P>

<P>
It was a scarcely perceptible trail, but the man found it, and followed
it with evident confidence. There was only the pause now and then to
steady his none-too-sure step, or to ease the burden of the bag. Very
soon the forest lay all about them, with the birds singing over their
heads, and with numberless tiny feet scurrying through the underbrush
on all sides. Just out of sight a brook babbled noisily of its delight
in being alive; and away up in the treetops the morning sun played
hide-and-seek among the dancing leaves.
</P>

<P>
And David leaped, and laughed, and loved it all, nor was any of it
strange to him. The birds, the trees, the sun, the brook, the scurrying
little creatures of the forest, all were friends of his. But the
man&mdash;the man did not leap or laugh, though he, too, loved it all. The
man was afraid.
</P>

<P>
He knew now that he had undertaken more than he could carry out. Step
by step the bag had grown heavier, and hour by hour the insistent,
teasing pain in his side had increased until now it was a torture. He
had forgotten that the way to the valley was so long; he had not
realized how nearly spent was his strength before he even started down
the trail. Throbbing through his brain was the question, what if, after
all, he could not&mdash;but even to himself he would not say the words.
</P>

<P>
At noon they paused for luncheon, and at night they camped where the
chattering brook had stopped to rest in a still, black pool. The next
morning the man and the boy picked up the trail again, but without the
bag. Under some leaves in a little hollow, the man had hidden the bag,
and had then said, as if casually:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"I believe, after all, I won't carry this along. There's nothing in it
that we really need, you know, now that I've taken out the luncheon
box, and by night we'll be down in the valley."
</P>

<P>
"Of course!" laughed David. "We don't need that." And he laughed again,
for pure joy. Little use had David for bags or baggage!
</P>

<P>
They were more than halfway down the mountain now, and soon they
reached a grass-grown road, little traveled, but yet a road. Still
later they came to where four ways crossed, and two of them bore the
marks of many wheels. By sundown the little brook at their side
murmured softly of quiet fields and meadows, and David knew that the
valley was reached.
</P>

<P>
David was not laughing now. He was watching his father with startled
eyes. David had not known what anxiety was. He was finding out
now&mdash;though he but vaguely realized that something was not right. For
some time his father had said but little, and that little had been in a
voice that was thick and unnatural-sounding. He was walking fast, yet
David noticed that every step seemed an effort, and that every breath
came in short gasps. His eyes were very bright, and were fixedly bent
on the road ahead, as if even the haste he was making was not haste
enough. Twice David spoke to him, but he did not answer; and the boy
could only trudge along on his weary little feet and sigh for the dear
home on the mountain-top which they had left behind them the morning
before.
</P>

<P>
They met few fellow travelers, and those they did meet paid scant
attention to the man and the boy carrying the violins. As it chanced,
there was no one in sight when the man, walking in the grass at the
side of the road, stumbled and fell heavily to the ground.
</P>

<P>
David sprang quickly forward.
</P>

<P>
"Father, what is it? WHAT IS IT?"
</P>

<P>
There was no answer.
</P>

<P>
"Daddy, why don't you speak to me? See, it's David!"
</P>

<P>
With a painful effort the man roused himself and sat up. For a moment
he gazed dully into the boy's face; then a half-forgotten something
seemed to stir him into feverish action. With shaking fingers he handed
David his watch and a small ivory miniature. Then he searched his
pockets until on the ground before him lay a shining pile of
gold-pieces&mdash;to David there seemed to be a hundred of them.
</P>

<P>
"Take them&mdash;hide them&mdash;keep them. David, until you&mdash;need them," panted
the man. "Then go&mdash;go on. I can't."
</P>

<P>
"Alone? Without you?" demurred the boy, aghast. "Why, father, I
couldn't! I don't know the way. Besides, I'd rather stay with you," he
added soothingly, as he slipped the watch and the miniature into his
pocket; "then we can both go." And he dropped himself down at his
father's side.
</P>

<P>
The man shook his head feebly, and pointed again to the gold-pieces.
</P>

<P>
"Take them, David,&mdash;hide them," he chattered with pale lips.
</P>

<P>
Almost impatiently the boy began picking up the money and tucking it
into his pockets.
</P>

<P>
"But, father, I'm not going without you," he declared stoutly, as the
last bit of gold slipped out of sight, and a horse and wagon rattled
around the turn of the road above.
</P>

<P>
The driver of the horse glanced disapprovingly at the man and the boy
by the roadside; but he did not stop. After he had passed, the boy
turned again to his father. The man was fumbling once more in his
pockets. This time from his coat he produced a pencil and a small
notebook from which he tore a page, and began to write, laboriously,
painfully.
</P>

<P>
David sighed and looked about him. He was tired and hungry, and he did
not understand things at all. Something very wrong, very terrible, must
be the matter with his father. Here it was almost dark, yet they had no
place to go, no supper to eat, while far, far up on the mountain-side
was their own dear home sad and lonely without them. Up there, too, the
sun still shone, doubtless,&mdash;at least there were the rose-glow and the
Silver Lake to look at, while down here there was nothing, nothing but
gray shadows, a long dreary road, and a straggling house or two in
sight. From above, the valley might look to be a fairyland of
loveliness, but in reality it was nothing but a dismal waste of gloom,
decided David.
</P>

<P>
David's father had torn a second page from his book and was beginning
another note, when the boy suddenly jumped to his feet. One of the
straggling houses was near the road where they sat, and its presence
had given David an idea. With swift steps he hurried to the front door
and knocked upon it. In answer a tall, unsmiling woman appeared, and
said, "Well?"
</P>

<P>
David removed his cap as his father had taught him to do when one of
the mountain women spoke to him.
</P>

<P>
"Good evening, lady; I'm David," he began frankly. "My father is so
tired he fell down back there, and we should like very much to stay
with you all night, if you don't mind."
</P>

<P>
The woman in the doorway stared. For a moment she was dumb with
amazement. Her eyes swept the plain, rather rough garments of the boy,
then sought the half-recumbent figure of the man by the roadside. Her
chin came up angrily.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, would you, indeed! Well, upon my word!" she scouted. "Humph! We
don't accommodate tramps, little boy." And she shut the door hard.
</P>

<P>
It was David's turn to stare. Just what a tramp might be, he did not
know; but never before had a request of his been so angrily refused. He
knew that. A fierce something rose within him&mdash;a fierce new something
that sent the swift red to his neck and brow. He raised a determined
hand to the doorknob&mdash;he had something to say to that woman!&mdash;when the
door suddenly opened again from the inside.
</P>

<P>
"See here, boy," began the woman, looking out at him a little less
unkindly, "if you're hungry I'll give you some milk and bread. Go
around to the back porch and I'll get it for you." And she shut the
door again.
</P>

<P>
David's hand dropped to his side. The red still stayed on his face and
neck, however, and that fierce new something within him bade him refuse
to take food from this woman.... But there was his father&mdash;his poor
father, who was so tired; and there was his own stomach clamoring to be
fed. No, he could not refuse. And with slow steps and hanging head
David went around the corner of the house to the rear.
</P>

<P>
As the half-loaf of bread and the pail of milk were placed in his
hands, David remembered suddenly that in the village store on the
mountain, his father paid money for his food. David was glad, now, that
he had those gold-pieces in his pocket, for he could pay money.
Instantly his head came up. Once more erect with self-respect, he
shifted his burdens to one hand and thrust the other into his pocket. A
moment later he presented on his outstretched palm a shining disk of
gold.
</P>

<P>
"Will you take this, to pay, please, for the bread and milk?" he asked
proudly.
</P>

<P>
The woman began to shake her head; but, as her eyes fell on the money,
she started, and bent closer to examine it. The next instant she jerked
herself upright with an angry exclamation.
</P>

<P>
"It's gold! A ten-dollar gold-piece! So you're a thief, too, are you,
as well as a tramp? Humph! Well, I guess you don't need this then," she
finished sharply, snatching the bread and the pail of milk from the
boy's hand.
</P>

<P>
The next moment David stood alone on the doorstep, with the sound of a
quickly thrown bolt in his ears.
</P>

<P>
A thief! David knew little of thieves, but he knew what they were. Only
a month before a man had tried to steal the violins from the cabin; and
he was a thief, the milk-boy said. David flushed now again, angrily, as
he faced the closed door. But he did not tarry. He turned and ran to
his father.
</P>

<P>
"Father, come away, quick! You must come away," he choked.
</P>

<P>
So urgent was the boy's voice that almost unconsciously the sick man
got to his feet. With shaking hands he thrust the notes he had been
writing into his pocket. The little book, from which he had torn the
leaves for this purpose, had already dropped unheeded into the grass at
his feet.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, son, yes, we'll go," muttered the man. "I feel better now. I
can&mdash;walk."
</P>

<P>
And he did walk, though very slowly, ten, a dozen, twenty steps. From
behind came the sound of wheels that stopped close beside them.
</P>

<P>
"Hullo, there! Going to the village?" called a voice.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, sir." David's answer was unhesitating. Where "the village" was,
he did not know; he knew only that it must be somewhere away from the
woman who had called him a thief. And that was all he cared to know.
</P>

<P>
"I'm going 'most there myself. Want a lift?" asked the man, still
kindly.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, sir. Thank you!" cried the boy joyfully. And together they aided
his father to climb into the roomy wagon-body.
</P>

<P>
There were few words said. The man at the reins drove rapidly, and paid
little attention to anything but his horses. The sick man dozed and
rested. The boy sat, wistful-eyed and silent, watching the trees and
houses flit by. The sun had long ago set, but it was not dark, for the
moon was round and bright, and the sky was cloudless. Where the road
forked sharply the man drew his horses to a stop.
</P>

<P>
"Well, I'm sorry, but I guess I'll have to drop you here, friends. I
turn off to the right; but 't ain't more 'n a quarter of a mile for
you, now" he finished cheerily, pointing with his whip to a cluster of
twinkling lights.
</P>

<P>
"Thank you, sir, thank you," breathed David gratefully, steadying his
father's steps. "You've helped us lots. Thank you!"
</P>

<P>
In David's heart was a wild desire to lay at his good man's feet all of
his shining gold-pieces as payment for this timely aid. But caution
held him back: it seemed that only in stores did money pay; outside it
branded one as a thief!
</P>

<P>
Alone with his father, David faced once more his problem. Where should
they go for the night? Plainly his father could not walk far. He had
begun to talk again, too,&mdash;low, half-finished sentences that David
could not understand, and that vaguely troubled him. There was a house
near by, and several others down the road toward the village; but David
had had all the experience he wanted that night with strange houses,
and strange women. There was a barn, a big one, which was nearest of
all; and it was toward this barn that David finally turned his father's
steps.
</P>

<P>
"We'll go there, daddy, if we can get in," he proposed softly. "And
we'll stay all night and rest."

CHAPTER III
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
THE VALLEY
</H3>

<P>
The long twilight of the June day had changed into a night that was
scarcely darker, so bright was the moonlight. Seen from the house, the
barn and the low buildings beyond loomed shadowy and unreal, yet very
beautiful. On the side porch of the house sat Simeon Holly and his
wife, content to rest mind and body only because a full day's work lay
well done behind them.
</P>

<P>
It was just as Simeon rose to his feet to go indoors that a long note
from a violin reached their ears.
</P>

<P>
"Simeon!" cried the woman. "What was that?"
</P>

<P>
The man did not answer. His eyes were fixed on the barn.
</P>

<P>
"Simeon, it's a fiddle!" exclaimed Mrs. Holly, as a second tone
quivered on the air "And it's in our barn!"
</P>

<P>
Simeon's jaw set. With a stern ejaculation he crossed the porch and
entered the kitchen.
</P>

<P>
In another minute he had returned, a lighted lantern in his hand.
</P>

<P>
"Simeon, d&mdash;don't go," begged the woman, tremulously. "You&mdash;you don't
know what's there."
</P>

<P>
"Fiddles are not played without hands, Ellen," retorted the man
severely. "Would you have me go to bed and leave a half-drunken,
ungodly minstrel fellow in possession of our barn? To-night, on my way
home, I passed a pretty pair of them lying by the roadside&mdash;a man and a
boy with two violins. They're the culprits, likely,&mdash;though how they
got this far, I don't see. Do you think I want to leave my barn to
tramps like them?"
</P>

<P>
"N&mdash;no, I suppose not," faltered the woman, as she rose tremblingly to
her feet, and followed her husband's shadow across the yard.
</P>

<P>
Once inside the barn Simeon Holly and his wife paused involuntarily.
The music was all about them now, filling the air with runs and trills
and rollicking bits of melody. Giving an angry exclamation, the man
turned then to the narrow stairway and climbed to the hayloft above. At
his heels came his wife, and so her eyes, almost as soon as his fell
upon the man lying back on the hay with the moonlight full upon his
face. Instantly the music dropped to a whisper, and a low voice came
out of the gloom beyond the square of moonlight which came from the
window in the roof.
</P>

<P>
"If you'll please be as still as you can, sir. You see he's asleep and
he's so tired," said the voice.
</P>

<P>
For a moment the man and the woman on the stairway paused in amazement,
then the man lifted his lantern and strode toward the voice.
</P>

<P>
"Who are you? What are you doing here?" he demanded sharply.
</P>

<P>
A boy's face, round, tanned, and just now a bit anxious, flashed out of
the dark.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, please, sir, if you would speak lower," pleaded the boy. "He's so
tired! I'm David, sir, and that's father. We came in here to rest and
sleep."
</P>

<P>
Simeon Holly's unrelenting gaze left the boy's face and swept that of
the man lying back on the hay. The next instant he lowered the lantern
and leaned nearer, putting forth a cautious hand. At once he
straightened himself, muttering a brusque word under his breath. Then
he turned with the angry question:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"Boy, what do you mean by playing a jig on your fiddle at such a time
as this?"
</P>

<P>
"Why, father asked me to play" returned the boy cheerily. "He said he
could walk through green forests then, with the ripple of brooks in his
ears, and that the birds and the squirrels&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"See here, boy, who are you?" cut in Simeon Holly sternly. "Where did
you come from?"
</P>

<P>
"From home, sir."
</P>

<P>
"Where is that?"
</P>

<P>
"Why, home, sir, where I live. In the mountains, 'way up, up, up&mdash;oh,
so far up! And there's such a big, big sky, so much nicer than down
here." The boy's voice quivered, and almost broke, and his eyes
constantly sought the white face on the hay.
</P>

<P>
It was then that Simeon Holly awoke to the sudden realization that it
was time for action. He turned to his wife.
</P>

<P>
"Take the boy to the house," he directed incisively. "We'll have to
keep him to-night, I suppose. I'll go for Higgins. Of course the whole
thing will have to be put in his hands at once. You can't do anything
here," he added, as he caught her questioning glance. "Leave everything
just as it is. The man is dead."
</P>

<P>
"Dead?" It was a sharp cry from the boy, yet there was more of wonder
than of terror in it. "Do you mean that he has gone&mdash;like the water in
the brook&mdash;to the far country?" he faltered.
</P>

<P>
Simeon Holly stared. Then he said more distinctly:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"Your father is dead, boy."
</P>

<P>
"And he won't come back any more?" David's voice broke now.
</P>

<P>
There was no answer. Mrs. Holly caught her breath convulsively and
looked away. Even Simeon Holly refused to meet the boy's pleading eyes.
</P>

<P>
With a quick cry David sprang to his father's side.
</P>

<P>
"But he's here&mdash;right here," he challenged shrilly. "Daddy, daddy,
speak to me! It's David!" Reaching out his hand, he gently touched his
father's face. He drew back then, at once, his eyes distended with
terror. "He isn't! He is&mdash;gone," he chattered frenziedly. "This isn't
the father-part that KNOWS. It's the other&mdash;that they leave. He's left
it behind him&mdash;like the squirrel, and the water in the brook."
</P>

<P>
Suddenly the boy's face changed. It grew rapt and luminous as he leaped
to his feet, crying joyously: "But he asked me to play, so he went
singing&mdash;singing just as he said that they did. And I made him walk
through green forests with the ripple of the brooks in his ears!
Listen&mdash;like this!" And once more the boy raised the violin to his
chin, and once more the music trilled and rippled about the shocked,
amazed ears of Simeon Holly and his wife.
</P>

<P>
For a time neither the man nor the woman could speak. There was nothing
in their humdrum, habit-smoothed tilling of the soil and washing of
pots and pans to prepare them for a scene like this&mdash;a moonlit barn, a
strange dead man, and that dead man's son babbling of brooks and
squirrels, and playing jigs on a fiddle for a dirge. At last, however,
Simeon found his voice.
</P>

<P>
"Boy, boy, stop that!" he thundered.  "Are you mad&mdash;clean mad? Go into
the house, I say!" And the boy, dazed but obedient, put up his violin,
and followed the woman, who, with tear-blinded eyes, was leading the
way down the stairs.
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Holly was frightened, but she was also strangely moved. From the
long ago the sound of another violin had come to her&mdash;a violin, too,
played by a boy's hands. But of this, all this, Mrs. Holly did not like
to think.
</P>

<P>
In the kitchen now she turned and faced her young guest.
</P>

<P>
"Are you hungry, little boy?"
</P>

<P>
David hesitated; he had not forgotten the woman, the milk, and the
gold-piece.
</P>

<P>
"Are you hungry&mdash;dear?" stammered Mrs. Holly again; and this time
David's clamorous stomach forced a "yes" from his unwilling lips; which
sent Mrs. Holly at once into the pantry for bread and milk and a
heaped-up plate of doughnuts such as David had never seen before.
</P>

<P>
Like any hungry boy David ate his supper; and Mrs. Holly, in the face
of this very ordinary sight of hunger being appeased at her table,
breathed more freely, and ventured to think that perhaps this strange
little boy was not so very strange, after all.
</P>

<P>
"What is your name?" she found courage to ask then.
</P>

<P>
"David."
</P>

<P>
"David what?"
</P>

<P>
"Just David."
</P>

<P>
"But your father's name?" Mrs. Holly had almost asked, but stopped in
time. She did not want to speak of him. "Where do you live?" she asked
instead.
</P>

<P>
"On the mountain, 'way up, up on the mountain where I can see my Silver
Lake every day, you know."
</P>

<P>
"But you didn't live there alone?"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, no; with father&mdash;before he&mdash;went away" faltered the boy.
</P>

<P>
The woman flushed red and bit her lip.
</P>

<P>
"No, no, I mean&mdash;were there no other houses but yours?" she stammered.
</P>

<P>
"No, ma'am."
</P>

<P>
"But, wasn't your mother&mdash;anywhere?"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, yes, in father's pocket."
</P>

<P>
"Your MOTHER&mdash;in your father's POCKET!"
</P>

<P>
So plainly aghast was the questioner that David looked not a little
surprised as he explained.
</P>

<P>
"You don't understand. She is an angel-mother, and angel-mothers don't
have anything only their pictures down here with us. And that's what we
have, and father always carried it in his pocket."
</P>

<P>
"Oh&mdash;&mdash;h," murmured Mrs. Holly, a quick mist in her eyes. Then, gently:
"And did you always live there&mdash;on the mountain?"
</P>

<P>
"Six years, father said."
</P>

<P>
"But what did you do all day? Weren't you ever&mdash;lonesome?"
</P>

<P>
"Lonesome?" The boy's eyes were puzzled.
</P>

<P>
"Yes. Didn't you miss things&mdash;people, other houses, boys of your own
age, and&mdash;and such things?"
</P>

<P>
David's eyes widened.
</P>

<P>
"Why, how could I?" he cried. "When I had daddy, and my violin, and my
Silver Lake, and the whole of the great big woods with everything in
them to talk to, and to talk to me?"
</P>

<P>
"Woods, and things in them to&mdash;to TALK to you!"
</P>

<P>
"Why, yes. It was the little brook, you know, after the squirrel, that
told me about being dead, and&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, yes; but never mind, dear, now," stammered the woman, rising
hurriedly to her feet&mdash;the boy was a little wild, after all, she
thought. "You&mdash;you should go to bed. Haven't you a&mdash;a bag, or&mdash;or
anything?"
</P>

<P>
"No, ma'am; we left it," smiled David apologetically. "You see, we had
so much in it that it got too heavy to carry. So we did n't bring it."
</P>

<P>
"So much in it you didn't bring it, indeed!" repeated Mrs. Holly, under
her breath, throwing up her hands with a gesture of despair. "Boy, what
are you, anyway?"
</P>

<P>
It was not meant for a question, but, to the woman's surprise, the boy
answered, frankly, simply:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"Father says that I'm one little instrument in the great Orchestra of
Life, and that I must see to it that I'm always in tune, and don't drag
or hit false notes."
</P>

<P>
"My land!" breathed the woman, dropping back in her chair, her eyes
fixed on the boy. Then, with an effort, she got to her feet.
</P>

<P>
"Come, you must go to bed," she stammered. "I'm sure bed is&mdash;is the
best place you. I think I can find what&mdash;what you need," she finished
feebly.
</P>

<P>
In a snug little room over the kitchen some minutes later, David found
himself at last alone. The room, though it had once belonged to a boy
of his own age, looked very strange to David. On the floor was a
rag-carpet rug, the first he had ever seen. On the walls were a
fishing-rod, a toy shotgun, and a case full of bugs and moths, each
little body impaled on a pin, to David's shuddering horror. The bed had
four tall posts at the corners, and a very puffy top that filled David
with wonder as to how he was to reach it, or stay there if he did gain
it. Across a chair lay a boy's long yellow-white nightshirt that the
kind lady had left, after hurriedly wiping her eyes with the edge of
its hem. In all the circle of the candlelight there was just one
familiar object to David's homesick eyes&mdash;the long black violin case
which he had brought in himself, and which held his beloved violin.
</P>

<P>
With his back carefully turned toward the impaled bugs and moths on the
wall, David undressed himself and slipped into the yellow-white
nightshirt, which he sniffed at gratefully, so like pine woods was the
perfume that hung about its folds. Then he blew out the candle and
groped his way to the one window the little room contained.
</P>

<P>
The moon still shone, but little could be seen through the thick green
branches of the tree outside. From the yard below came the sound of
wheels, and of men's excited voices. There came also the twinkle of
lanterns borne by hurrying hands, and the tramp of shuffling feet. In
the window David shivered. There were no wide sweep of mountain, hill,
and valley, no Silver Lake, no restful hush, no daddy,&mdash;no beautiful
Things that Were. There was only the dreary, hollow mockery of the
Things they had Become.
</P>

<P>
Long minutes later, David, with the violin in his arms, lay down upon
the rug, and, for the first time since babyhood, sobbed himself to
sleep&mdash;but it was a sleep that brought no rest; for in it he dreamed
that he was a big, white-winged moth pinned with a star to an ink-black
sky.

CHAPTER IV
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
TWO LETTERS
</H3>

<P>
In the early gray dawn David awoke. His first sensation was the
physical numbness and stiffness that came from his hard bed on the
floor.
</P>

<P>
"Why, daddy," he began, pulling himself half-erect, "I slept all night
on&mdash;" He stopped suddenly, brushing his eyes with the backs of his
hands. "Why, daddy, where&mdash;" Then full consciousness came to him.
</P>

<P>
With a low cry he sprang to his feet and ran to the window. Through the
trees he could see the sunrise glow of the eastern sky. Down in the
yard no one was in sight; but the barn door was open, and, with a quick
indrawing of his breath, David turned back into the room and began to
thrust himself into his clothing.
</P>

<P>
The gold in his sagging pockets clinked and jingled musically; and once
half a dozen pieces rolled out upon the floor. For a moment the boy
looked as if he were going to let them remain where they were. But the
next minute, with an impatient gesture, he had picked them up and
thrust them deep into one of his pockets, silencing their jingling with
his handkerchief.
</P>

<P>
Once dressed, David picked up his violin and stepped softly into the
hall. At first no sound reached his ears; then from the kitchen below
came the clatter of brisk feet and the rattle of tins and crockery.
Tightening his clasp on the violin, David slipped quietly down the back
stairs and out to the yard. It was only a few seconds then before he
was hurrying through the open doorway of the barn and up the narrow
stairway to the loft above.
</P>

<P>
At the top, however, he came to a sharp pause, with a low cry. The next
moment he turned to see a kindly-faced man looking up at him from the
foot of the stairs.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, sir, please&mdash;please, where is he? What have you done with him?"
appealed the boy, almost plunging headlong down the stairs in his haste
to reach the bottom.
</P>

<P>
Into the man's weather-beaten face came a look of sincere but awkward
sympathy.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, hullo, sonny! So you're the boy, are ye?" he began diffidently.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, yes, I'm David. But where is he&mdash;my father, you know? I mean
the&mdash;the part he&mdash;he left behind him?" choked the boy. "The part
like&mdash;the ice-coat?"
</P>

<P>
The man stared. Then, involuntarily, he began to back away.
</P>

<P>
"Well, ye see, I&mdash;I&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"But, maybe you don't know," interrupted David feverishly. "You aren't
the man I saw last night. Who are you? Where is he&mdash;the other one,
please?"
</P>

<P>
"No, I&mdash;I wa'n't here&mdash;that is, not at the first," spoke up the man
quickly, still unconsciously backing away. "Me&mdash;I'm only Larson, Perry
Larson, ye know. 'T was Mr. Holly you see last night&mdash;him that I works
for."
</P>

<P>
"Then, where is Mr. Holly, please?" faltered the boy, hurrying toward
the barn door. "Maybe he would know&mdash;about father. Oh, there he is!"
And David ran out of the barn and across the yard to the kitchen porch.
</P>

<P>
It was an unhappy ten minutes that David spent then. Besides Mr. Holly,
there were Mrs. Holly, and the man, Perry Larson. And they all talked.
But little of what they said could David understand. To none of his
questions could he obtain an answer that satisfied.
</P>

<P>
Neither, on his part, could he seem to reply to their questions in a
way that pleased them.
</P>

<P>
They went in to breakfast then, Mr. and Mrs. Holly, and the man, Perry
Larson. They asked David to go&mdash;at least, Mrs. Holly asked him. But
David shook his head and said "No, no, thank you very much; I'd rather
not, if you please&mdash;not now." Then he dropped himself down on the steps
to think. As if he could EAT&mdash;with that great choking lump in his
throat that refused to be swallowed!
</P>

<P>
David was thoroughly dazed, frightened, and dismayed. He knew now that
never again in this world would he see his dear father, or hear him
speak. This much had been made very clear to him during the last ten
minutes. Why this should be so, or what his father would want him to
do, he could not seem to find out. Not until now had he realized at all
what this going away of his father was to mean to him. And he told
himself frantically that he could not have it so. HE COULD NOT HAVE IT
SO! But even as he said the words, he knew that it was so&mdash;irrevocably
so.
</P>

<P>
 David began then to long for his mountain home. There at least<BR>
he would have his dear forest all about him, with the birds and the
squirrels and the friendly little brooks. There he would have his
Silver Lake to look at, too, and all of them would speak to him of his
father.  He believed, indeed, that up there it would almost seem as if
his father were really with him. And, anyway, if his father ever should
come back, it would be there that he would be sure to seek him&mdash;up
there in the little mountain home so dear to them both. Back to the
cabin he would go now, then. Yes; indeed he would!
</P>

<P>
With a low word and a passionately intent expression, David got to his
feet, picked up his violin, and hurried, firm-footed, down the driveway
and out upon the main highway, turning in the direction from whence he
had come with his father the night before.
</P>

<P>
The Hollys had just finished breakfast when Higgins, the coroner, drove
into the yard accompanied by William Streeter, the town's most
prominent farmer,&mdash;and the most miserly one, if report was to be
credited.
</P>

<P>
"Well, could you get anything out of the boy?" demanded Higgins,
without ceremony, as Simeon Holly and Larson appeared on the kitchen
porch.
</P>

<P>
"Very little. Really nothing of importance," answered Simeon Holly.
</P>

<P>
"Where is he now?"
</P>

<P>
"Why, he was here on the steps a few minutes ago." Simeon Holly looked
about him a bit impatiently.
</P>

<P>
"Well, I want to see him. I've got a letter for him."
</P>

<P>
"A letter!" exclaimed Simeon Holly and Larson in amazed unison.
</P>

<P>
"Yes. Found it in his father's pocket," nodded the coroner, with all
the tantalizing brevity of a man who knows he has a choice morsel of
information that is eagerly awaited. "It's addressed to 'My boy David,'
so I calculated we'd better give it to him first without reading it,
seeing it's his. After he reads it, though, I want to see it. I want to
see if what it says is any nearer being horse-sense than the other one
is."
</P>

<P>
"The other one!" exclaimed the amazed chorus again.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, yes, there's another one," spoke up William Streeter tersely. "And
I've read it&mdash;all but the scrawl at the end. There couldn't anybody
read that!" Higgins laughed.
</P>

<P>
"Well, I'm free to confess 't is a sticker&mdash;that name," he admitted.
"And it's the name we want, of course, to tell us who they are&mdash;since
it seems the boy don't know, from what you said last night. I was in
hopes, by this morning, you'd have found out more from him."
</P>

<P>
Simeon Holly shook his head.
</P>

<P>
"'T was impossible."
</P>

<P>
"Gosh! I should say 't was," cut in Perry Larson, with emphasis. "An'
queer ain't no name for it. One minute he'd be talkin' good common
sense like anybody: an' the next he'd be chatterin' of coats made o'
ice, an' birds an' squirrels an' babbling brooks. He sure is dippy!
Listen. He actually don't seem ter know the diff'rence between himself
an' his fiddle. We was tryin' ter find out this mornin' what he could
do, an' what he wanted ter do, when if he didn't up an' say that his
father told him it didn't make so much diff'rence WHAT he did so long
as he kept hisself in tune an' didn't strike false notes. Now, what do
yer think o' that?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, I, know" nodded Higgins musingly. "There WAS something queer
about them, and they weren't just ordinary tramps. Did I tell you? I
overtook them last night away up on the Fairbanks road by the Taylor
place, and I gave 'em a lift. I particularly noticed what a decent sort
they were. They were clean and quiet-spoken, and their clothes were
good, even if they were rough. Yet they didn't have any baggage but
them fiddles."
</P>

<P>
"But what was that second letter you mentioned?" asked Simeon Holly.
</P>

<P>
Higgins smiled oddly, and reached into his pocket.
</P>

<P>
"The letter? Oh, you're welcome to read the letter," he said, as he
handed over a bit of folded paper.
</P>

<P>
Simeon took it gingerly and examined it.
</P>

<P>
It was a leaf torn apparently from a note book. It was folded three
times, and bore on the outside the superscription "To whom it may
concern." The handwriting was peculiar, irregular, and not very
legible. But as near as it could be deciphered, the note ran thus:&mdash;
</P>

<BR>

<P>
Now that the time has come when I must give David back to the world, I
have set out for that purpose.
</P>

<P>
But I am ill&mdash;very ill, and should Death have swifter feet than I, I
must leave my task for others to complete. Deal gently with him. He
knows only that which is good and beautiful. He knows nothing of sin
nor evil.
</P>

<BR>

<P>
Then followed the signature&mdash;a thing of scrawls and flourishes that
conveyed no sort of meaning to Simeon Holly's puzzled eyes.
</P>

<P>
"Well?" prompted Higgins expectantly.
</P>

<P>
Simeon Holly shook his head.
</P>

<P>
"I can make little of it. It certainly is a most remarkable note."
</P>

<P>
"Could you read the name?"
</P>

<P>
"No."
</P>

<P>
"Well, I couldn't. Neither could half a dozen others that's seen it.
But where's the boy? Mebbe his note'll talk sense."
</P>

<P>
"I'll go find him," volunteered Larson. "He must be somewheres 'round."
</P>

<P>
But David was very evidently not "somewheres 'round." At least he was
not in the barn, the shed, the kitchen bedroom, nor anywhere else that
Larson looked; and the man was just coming back with a crestfallen,
perplexed frown, when Mrs. Holly hurried out on to the porch.
</P>

<P>
"Mr. Higgins," she cried, in obvious excitement, "your wife has just
telephoned that her sister Mollie has just telephoned HER that that
little tramp boy with the violin is at her house."
</P>

<P>
"At Mollie's!" exclaimed Higgins. "Why, that's a mile or more from
here."
</P>

<P>
"So that's where he is!" interposed Larson, hurrying forward. "Doggone
the little rascal! He must 'a' slipped away while we was eatin'
breakfast."
</P>

<P>
"Yes. But, Simeon,&mdash;Mr. Higgins,&mdash;we hadn't ought to let him go like
that," appealed Mrs. Holly tremulously. "Your wife said Mollie said she
found him crying at the crossroads, because he didn't know which way to
take. He said he was going back home. He means to that wretched cabin
on the mountain, you know; and we can't let him do that alone&mdash;a child
like that!"
</P>

<P>
"Where is he now?" demanded Higgins.
</P>

<P>
"In Mollie's kitchen eating bread and milk; but she said she had an
awful time getting him to eat. And she wants to know what to do with
him. That's why she telephoned your wife. She thought you ought to know
he was there."
</P>

<P>
"Yes, of course. Well, tell her to tell him to come back."
</P>

<P>
"Mollie said she tried to have him come back, but that he said, no,
thank you, he'd rather not. He was going home where his father could
find him if he should ever want him. Mr. Higgins, we&mdash;we CAN'T let him
go off like that. Why, the child would die up there alone in those
dreadful woods, even if he could get there in the first place&mdash;which I
very much doubt."
</P>

<P>
"Yes, of course, of course," muttered Higgins, with a thoughtful frown.
"There's his letter, too. Say!" he added, brightening, "what'll you bet
that letter won't fetch him? He seems to think the world and all of his
daddy. Here," he directed, turning to Mrs. Holly, "you tell my wife to
tell&mdash;better yet, you telephone Mollie yourself, please, and tell her
to tell the boy we've got a letter here for him from his father, and he
can have it if he'll come back.".
</P>

<P>
"I will, I will," called Mrs. Holly, over her shoulder, as she hurried
into the house. In an unbelievably short time she was back, her face
beaming.
</P>

<P>
"He's started, so soon," she nodded. "He's crazy with joy, Mollie said.
He even left part of his breakfast, he was in such a hurry. So I guess
we'll see him all right."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, yes, we'll see him all right," echoed Simeon Holly grimly. "But
that isn't telling what we'll do with him when we do see him."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, well, maybe this letter of his will help us out on that,"
suggested Higgins soothingly. "Anyhow, even if it doesn't, I'm not
worrying any. I guess some one will want him&mdash;a good healthy boy like
that."
</P>

<P>
"Did you find any money on the body?" asked Streeter.
</P>

<P>
"A little change&mdash;a few cents. Nothing to count. If the boy's letter
doesn't tell us where any of their folks are, it'll be up to the town
to bury him all right."
</P>

<P>
"He had a fiddle, didn't he? And the boy had one, too. Wouldn't they
bring anything?" Streeter's round blue eyes gleamed shrewdly.
</P>

<P>
Higgins gave a slow shake of his head.
</P>

<P>
"Maybe&mdash;if there was a market for 'em. But who'd buy 'em? There ain't a
soul in town plays but Jack Gurnsey; and he's got one. Besides, he's
sick, and got all he can do to buy bread and butter for him and his
sister without taking in more fiddles, I guess. HE wouldn't buy 'em."
</P>

<P>
"Hm&mdash;m; maybe not, maybe not," grunted Streeter. "An', as you say, he's
the only one that's got any use for 'em here; an' like enough they
ain't worth much, anyway. So I guess 't is up to the town all right."
</P>

<P>
"Yes; but&mdash;if yer'll take it from me,"&mdash;interrupted Larson,&mdash;"you'll be
wise if ye keep still before the boy. It's no use ASKIN' him anythin'.
We've proved that fast enough. An' if he once turns 'round an' begins
ter ask YOU questions, yer done for!"
</P>

<P>
"I guess you're right," nodded Higgins, with a quizzical smile. "And as
long as questioning CAN'T do any good, why, we'll just keep whist
before the boy. Meanwhile I wish the little rascal would hurry up and
get here. I want to see the inside of that letter to HIM. I'm relying
on that being some help to unsnarl this tangle of telling who they are."
</P>

<P>
"Well, he's started," reiterated Mrs. Holly, as she turned back into
the house; "so I guess he'll get here if you wait long enough."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, yes, he'll get here if we wait long enough," echoed Simeon Holly
again, crustily.
</P>

<P>
The two men in the wagon settled themselves more comfortably in their
seats, and Perry Larson, after a half-uneasy, half-apologetic glance at
his employer, dropped himself onto the bottom step. Simeon Holly had
already sat down stiffly in one of the porch chairs. Simeon Holly never
"dropped himself" anywhere. Indeed, according to Perry Larson, if there
were a hard way to do a thing, Simeon Holly found it&mdash;and did it. The
fact that, this morning, he had allowed, and was still allowing, the
sacred routine of the day's work to be thus interrupted, for nothing
more important than the expected arrival of a strolling urchin, was
something Larson would not have believed had he not seen it. Even now
he was conscious once or twice of an involuntary desire to rub his eyes
to make sure they were not deceiving him.
</P>

<P>
Impatient as the waiting men were for the arrival of David, they were
yet almost surprised, so soon did he appear, running up the driveway.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, where is it, please?" he panted. "They said you had a letter for
me from daddy!"
</P>

<P>
"You're right, sonny; we have. And here it is," answered Higgins
promptly, holding out the folded paper.
</P>

<P>
Plainly eager as he was, David did not open the note till he had first
carefully set down the case holding his violin; then he devoured it
with eager eyes.
</P>

<P>
As he read, the four men watched his face. They saw first the quick
tears that had to be blinked away. Then they saw the radiant glow that
grew and deepened until the whole boyish face was aflame with the
splendor of it. They saw the shining wonder of his eyes, too, as he
looked up from the letter.
</P>

<P>
"And daddy wrote this to me from the far country?" he breathed.
</P>

<P>
Simeon Holly scowled. Larson choked over a stifled chuckle. William
Streeter stared and shrugged his shoulders; but Higgins flushed a dull
red.
</P>

<P>
"No, sonny," he stammered. "We found it on the&mdash;er&mdash;I mean,
it&mdash;er&mdash;your father left it in his pocket for you," finished the man, a
little explosively.
</P>

<P>
A swift shadow crossed the boy's face.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, I hoped I'd heard&mdash;" he began. Then suddenly he stopped, his face
once more alight. "But it's 'most the same as if he wrote it from
there, isn't it? He left it for me, and he told me what to do."
</P>

<P>
"What's that, what's that?" cried Higgins, instantly alert.  "DID he
tell you what to do? Then, let's have it, so WE'LL know. You will let
us read it, won't you, boy?"
</P>

<P>
"Why, y&mdash;yes," stammered David, holding it out politely, but with
evident reluctance.
</P>

<P>
"Thank you," nodded Higgins, as he reached for the note.
</P>

<P>
David's letter was very different from the other one. It was longer,
but it did not help much, though it was easily read. In his letter, in
spite of the wavering lines, each word was formed with a care that told
of a father's thought for the young eyes that would read it. It was
written on two of the notebook's leaves, and at the end came the single
word "Daddy."
</P>

<BR>

<P CLASS="letter">
David, my boy [read Higgins aloud], in the far country I am waiting for
you. Do not grieve, for that will grieve me. I shall not return, but
some day you will come to me, your violin at your chin, and the bow
drawn across the strings to greet me. See that it tells me of the
beautiful world you have left&mdash;for it is a beautiful world, David;
never forget that. And if sometime you are tempted to think it is not a
beautiful world, just remember that you yourself can make it beautiful
if you will.
</P>

<P CLASS="letter">
You are among new faces, surrounded by things and people that are
strange to you. Some of them you will not understand; some of them you
may not like. But do not fear, David, and do not plead to go back to
the hills. Remember this, my boy,&mdash;in your violin lie all the things
you long for. You have only to play, and the broad skies of your
mountain home will be over you, and the dear friends and comrades of
your mountain forests will be about you.
<BR><BR>
                                                          DADDY.<BR>
</P>

<BR>

<P>
"Gorry! that's worse than the other," groaned Higgins, when he had
finished the note. "There's actually nothing in it! Wouldn't you
think&mdash;if a man wrote anything at such a time&mdash;that he'd 'a' wrote
something that had some sense to it&mdash;something that one could get hold
of, and find out who the boy is?"
</P>

<P>
There was no answering this. The assembled men could only grunt and nod
in agreement, which, after all, was no real help.

CHAPTER V
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
DISCORDS
</H3>

<P>
The dead man found in Farmer Holly's barn created a decided stir in the
village of Hinsdale. The case was a peculiar one for many reasons.
First, because of the boy&mdash;Hinsdale supposed it knew boys, but it felt
inclined to change its mind after seeing this one. Second, because of
the circumstances. The boy and his father had entered the town like
tramps, yet Higgins, who talked freely of his having given the pair a
"lift" on that very evening, did not hesitate to declare that he did
not believe them to be ordinary tramps at all.
</P>

<P>
As there had been little found in the dead man's pockets, save the two
notes, and as nobody could be found who wanted the violins, there
seemed to be nothing to do but to turn the body over to the town for
burial. Nothing was said of this to David; indeed, as little as
possible was said to David about anything after that morning when
Higgins had given him his father's letter. At that time the men had
made one more effort to "get track of SOMETHING," as Higgins had
despairingly put it. But the boy's answers to their questions were
anything but satisfying, anything but helpful, and were often most
disconcerting. The boy was, in fact, regarded by most of the men, after
that morning, as being "a little off"; and was hence let severely alone.
</P>

<P>
Who the man was the town authorities certainly did not know, neither
could they apparently find out. His name, as written by himself, was
unreadable. His notes told nothing; his son could tell little more&mdash;of
consequence. A report, to be sure, did come from the village, far up
the mountain, that such a man and boy had lived in a hut that was
almost inaccessible; but even this did not help solve the mystery.
</P>

<P>
David was left at the Holly farmhouse, though Simeon Holly mentally
declared that he should lose no time in looking about for some one to
take the boy away.
</P>

<P>
On that first day Higgins, picking up the reins preparatory to driving
from the yard, had said, with a nod of his head toward David:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"Well, how about it, Holly? Shall we leave him here till we find
somebody that wants him?"
</P>

<P>
"Why, y&mdash;yes, I suppose so," hesitated Simeon Holly, with uncordial
accent.
</P>

<P>
But his wife, hovering in the background, hastened forward at once.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, yes; yes, indeed," she urged. "I'm sure he&mdash;he won't be a mite of
trouble, Simeon."
</P>

<P>
"Perhaps not," conceded Simeon Holly darkly. "Neither, it is safe to
say, will he be anything else&mdash;worth anything."
</P>

<P>
"That's it exactly," spoke up Streeter, from his seat in the wagon. "If
I thought he'd be worth his salt, now, I'd take him myself; but&mdash;well,
look at him this minute," he finished, with a disdainful shrug.
</P>

<P>
David, on the lowest step, was very evidently not hearing a word of
what was being said. With his sensitive face illumined, he was again
poring over his father's letter.
</P>

<P>
Something in the sudden quiet cut through his absorption as the noisy
hum of voices had not been able to do, and he raised his head. His eyes
were starlike.
</P>

<P>
"I'm so glad father told me what to do," he breathed. "It'll be easier
now."
</P>

<P>
Receiving no answer from the somewhat awkwardly silent men, he went on,
as if in explanation:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"You know he's waiting for me&mdash;in the far country, I mean. He said he
was. And when you've got somebody waiting, you don't mind staying
behind yourself for a little while. Besides, I've GOT to stay to find
out about the beautiful world, you know, so I can tell him, when <I>I</I>
go. That's the way I used to do back home on the mountain, you
see,&mdash;tell him about things. Lots of days we'd go to walk; then, when
we got home, he'd have me tell him, with my violin, what I'd seen. And
now he says I'm to stay here."
</P>

<P>
"Here!" It was the quick, stern voice of Simeon Holly.
</P>

<P>
"Yes," nodded David earnestly; "to learn about the beautiful world.
Don't you remember? And he said I was not to want to go back to my
mountains; that I would not need to, anyway, because the mountains, and
the sky, and the birds and squirrels and brooks are really in my
violin, you know. And&mdash;"  But with an angry frown Simeon Holly stalked
away, motioning Larson to follow him; and with a merry glance and a low
chuckle Higgins turned his horse about and drove from the yard. A
moment later David found himself alone with Mrs. Holly, who was looking
at him with wistful, though slightly fearful eyes.
</P>

<P>
"Did you have all the breakfast you wanted?" she asked timidly,
resorting, as she had resorted the night before, to the everyday things
of her world in the hope that they might make this strange little boy
seem less wild, and more nearly human.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, yes, thank you." David's eyes had strayed back to the note in his
hand. Suddenly he looked up, a new something in his eyes. "What is it
to be a&mdash;a tramp?" he asked. "Those men said daddy and I were tramps."
</P>

<P>
"A tramp? Oh&mdash;er&mdash;why, just a&mdash;a tramp," stammered Mrs. Holly. "But
never mind that, David. I&mdash;I wouldn't think any more about it."
</P>

<P>
"But what is a tramp?" persisted David, a smouldering fire beginning to
show in his eyes. "Because if they meant THIEVES&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"No, no, David," interrupted Mrs. Holly soothingly. "They never meant
thieves at all."
</P>

<P>
"Then, what is it to be a tramp?"
</P>

<P>
"Why, it's just to&mdash;to tramp," explained Mrs. Holly desperately;&mdash;"walk
along the road from one town to another, and&mdash;and not live in a house
at all."
</P>

<P>
"Oh!" David's face cleared. "That's all right, then. I'd love to be a
tramp, and so'd father. And we were tramps, sometimes, too, 'cause lots
of times, in the summer, we didn't stay in the cabin hardly any&mdash;just
lived out of doors all day and all night. Why, I never knew really what
the pine trees were saying till I heard them at night, lying under
them. You know what I mean. You've heard them, haven't you?"
</P>

<P>
"At night? Pine trees?" stammered Mrs. Holly helplessly.
</P>

<P>
"Yes. Oh, haven't you ever heard them at night?" cried the boy, in his
voice a very genuine sympathy as for a grievous loss. "Why, then, if
you've only heard them daytimes, you don't know a bit what pine trees
really are. But I can tell you. Listen! This is what they say,"
finished the boy, whipping his violin from its case, and, after a swift
testing of the strings, plunging into a weird, haunting little melody.
</P>

<P>
In the doorway, Mrs. Holly, bewildered, yet bewitched, stood
motionless, her eyes half-fearfully, half-longingly fixed on David's
glorified face. She was still in the same position when Simeon Holly
came around the corner of the house.
</P>

<P>
"Well, Ellen," he began, with quiet scorn, after a moment's stern
watching of the scene before him, "have you nothing better to do this
morning than to listen to this minstrel fellow?"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, Simeon! Why, yes, of course. I&mdash;I forgot&mdash;what I was doing,"
faltered Mrs. Holly, flushing guiltily from neck to brow as she turned
and hurried into the house.
</P>

<P>
David, on the porch steps, seemed to have heard nothing. He was still
playing, his rapt gaze on the distant sky-line, when Simeon Holly
turned upon him with disapproving eyes.
</P>

<P>
"See here, boy, can't you do anything but fiddle?" he demanded. Then,
as David still continued to play, he added sharply:  "Did n't you hear
me, boy?"
</P>

<P>
The music stopped abruptly. David looked up with the slightly dazed air
of one who has been summoned as from another world.
</P>

<P>
"Did you speak to me, sir?" he asked.
</P>

<P>
"I did&mdash;twice. I asked if you never did anything but play that fiddle."
</P>

<P>
"You mean at home?" David's face expressed mild wonder without a trace
of anger or resentment. "Why, yes, of course. I couldn't play ALL the
time, you know. I had to eat and sleep and study my books; and every
day we went to walk&mdash;like tramps, as you call them," he elucidated, his
face brightening with obvious delight at being able, for once, to
explain matters in terms that he felt sure would be understood.
</P>

<P>
"Tramps, indeed!" muttered Simeon Holly, under his breath. Then,
sharply: "Did you never perform any useful labor, boy? Were your days
always spent in this ungodly idleness?"
</P>

<P>
Again David frowned in mild wonder.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, I wasn't idle, sir. Father said I must never be that. He said
every instrument was needed in the great Orchestra of Life; and that I
was one, you know, even if I was only a little boy. And he said if I
kept still and didn't do my part, the harmony wouldn't be complete,
and&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, yes, but never mind that now, boy," interrupted Simeon Holly,
with harsh impatience. "I mean, did he never set you to work&mdash;real
work?"
</P>

<P>
"Work?" David meditated again. Then suddenly his face cleared. "Oh,
yes, sir, he said I had a beautiful work to do, and that it was waiting
for me out in the world. That's why we came down from the mountain, you
know, to find it. Is that what you mean?"
</P>

<P>
"Well, no," retorted the man, "I can't say that it was. I was referring
to work&mdash;real work about the house. Did you never do any of that?"
</P>

<P>
David gave a relieved laugh.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, you mean getting the meals and tidying up the house," he replied.
"Oh, yes, I did that with father, only"&mdash;his face grew wistful&mdash;"I'm
afraid I didn't do it very well. My bacon was never as nice and crisp
as father's, and the fire was always spoiling my potatoes."
</P>

<P>
"Humph! bacon and potatoes, indeed!" scorned Simeon Holly. "Well, boy,
we call that women's work down here. We set men to something else. Do
you see that woodpile by the shed door?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, sir."
</P>

<P>
"Very good. In the kitchen you'll find an empty woodbox. Do you think
you could fill it with wood from that woodpile? You'll find plenty of
short, small sticks already chopped."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, yes, sir, I'd like to," nodded David, hastily but carefully
tucking his violin into its case. A minute later he had attacked the
woodpile with a will; and Simeon Holly, after a sharply watchful
glance, had turned away.
</P>

<P>
But the woodbox, after all, was not filled. At least, it was not filled
immediately, for at the very beginning of gathering the second armful
of wood, David picked up a stick that had long lain in one position on
the ground, thereby disclosing sundry and diverse crawling things of
many legs, which filled David's soul with delight, and drove away every
thought of the empty woodbox.
</P>

<P>
It was only a matter of some strength and more patience, and still more
time, to overturn other and bigger sticks, to find other and bigger of
the many-legged, many-jointed creatures. One, indeed, was so very
wonderful that David, with a whoop of glee, summoned Mrs. Holly from
the shed doorway to come and see.
</P>

<P>
So urgent was his plea that Mrs. Holly came with hurried steps&mdash;but she
went away with steps even more hurried; and David, sitting back on his
woodpile seat, was left to wonder why she should scream and shudder and
say "Ugh-h-h!" at such a beautiful, interesting thing as was this
little creature who lived in her woodpile.
</P>

<P>
Even then David did not think of that empty woodbox waiting behind the
kitchen stove. This time it was a butterfly, a big black butterfly
banded with gold; and it danced and fluttered all through the back yard
and out into the garden, David delightedly following with soft-treading
steps, and movements that would not startle. From the garden to the
orchard, and from the orchard back to the garden danced the
butterfly&mdash;and David; and in the garden, near the house, David came
upon Mrs. Holly's pansy-bed. Even the butterfly was forgotten then, for
down in the path by the pansy-bed David dropped to his knees in
veritable worship.
</P>

<P>
"Why, you're just like little people," he cried softly. "You've got
faces; and some of you are happy, and some of you are sad. And you&mdash;you
big spotted yellow one&mdash;you're laughing at me. Oh, I'm going to play
you&mdash;all of you. You'll make such a pretty song, you're so different
from each other!" And David leaped lightly to his feet and ran around
to the side porch for his violin.
</P>

<P>
Five minutes later, Simeon Holly, coming into the kitchen, heard the
sound of a violin through the open window. At the same moment his eyes
fell on the woodbox, empty save for a few small sticks at the bottom.
With an angry frown he strode through the outer door and around the
corner of the house to the garden. At once then he came upon David,
sitting Turk-fashion in the middle of the path before the pansy-bed,
his violin at his chin, and his whole face aglow.
</P>

<P>
"Well, boy, is this the way you fill the woodbox?" demanded the man
crisply.
</P>

<P>
David shook his head.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, no, sir, this isn't filling the woodbox," he laughed, softening
his music, but not stopping it. "Did you think that was what I was
playing? It's the flowers here that I'm playing&mdash;the little faces, like
people, you know. See, this is that big yellow one over there that's
laughing," he finished, letting the music under his fingers burst into
a gay little melody.
</P>

<P>
Simeon Holly raised an imperious hand; and at the gesture David stopped
his melody in the middle of a run, his eyes flying wide open in plain
wonderment.
</P>

<P>
"You mean&mdash;I'm not playing&mdash;right?" he asked.
</P>

<P>
"I'm not talking of your playing," retorted Simeon Holly severely. "I'm
talking of that woodbox I asked you to fill."
</P>

<P>
David's face cleared.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, yes, sir. I'll go and do it," he nodded, getting cheerfully to his
feet.
</P>

<P>
"But I told you to do it before."
</P>

<P>
David's eyes grew puzzled again.
</P>

<P>
"I know, sir, and I started to," he answered, with the obvious patience
of one who finds himself obliged to explain what should be a
self-evident fact; "but I saw so many beautiful things, one after
another, and when I found these funny little flower-people I just had
to play them. Don't you see?"
</P>

<P>
"No, I can't say that I do, when I'd already told you to fill the
woodbox," rejoined the man, with uncompromising coldness.
</P>

<P>
"You mean&mdash;even then that I ought to have filled the woodbox first?"
</P>

<P>
"I certainly do."
</P>

<P>
David's eyes flew wide open again.
</P>

<P>
"But my song&mdash;I'd have lost it!" he exclaimed. "And father said always
when a song came to me to play it at once. Songs are like the mists of
the morning and the rainbows, you know, and they don't stay with you
long. You just have to catch them quick, before they go. Now, don't you
see?"
</P>

<P>
But Simeon Holly, with a despairingly scornful gesture, had turned
away; and David, after a moment's following him with wistful eyes,
soberly walked toward the kitchen door. Two minutes later he was
industriously working at his task of filling the woodbox.
</P>

<P>
That for David the affair was not satisfactorily settled was evidenced
by his thoughtful countenance and preoccupied air, however; nor were
matters helped any by the question David put to Mr. Holly just before
dinner.
</P>

<P>
"Do you mean," he asked, "that because I didn't fill the woodbox right
away, I was being a discord?"
</P>

<P>
"You were what?" demanded the amazed Simeon Holly.
</P>

<P>
"Being a discord&mdash;playing out of tune, you know," explained David, with
patient earnestness. "Father said&mdash;" But again Simeon Holly had turned
irritably away; and David was left with his perplexed questions still
unanswered.
</P>

CHAPTER VI
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
NUISANCES, NECESSARY AND OTHERWISE
</H3>

<P>
For some time after dinner, that first day, David watched Mrs. Holly in
silence while she cleared the table and began to wash the dishes.
</P>

<P>
"Do you want me to&mdash;help?" he asked at last, a little wistfully.
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Holly, with a dubious glance at the boy's brown little hands,
shook her head.
</P>

<P>
"No, I don't. No, thank you," she amended her answer.
</P>

<P>
For another sixty seconds David was silent; then, still more wistfully,
he asked:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"Are all these things you've been doing all day 'useful labor'?"
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Holly lifted dripping hands from the dishpan and held them
suspended for an amazed instant.
</P>

<P>
"Are they&mdash;Why, of course they are! What a silly question! What put
that idea into your head, child?"
</P>

<P>
"Mr. Holly; and you see it's so different from what father used to call
them."
</P>

<P>
"Different?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes. He said they were a necessary nuisance,&mdash;dishes, and getting
meals, and clearing up,&mdash;and he didn't do half as many of them as you
do, either."
</P>

<P>
"Nuisance, indeed!" Mrs. Holly resumed her dishwashing with some
asperity. "Well, I should think that might have been just about like
him."
</P>

<P>
"Yes, it was. He was always that way," nodded David pleasantly. Then,
after a moment, he queried: "But aren't you going to walk at all
to-day?"
</P>

<P>
"To walk? Where?"
</P>

<P>
"Why, through the woods and fields&mdash;anywhere."
</P>

<P>
"Walking in the woods, NOW&mdash;JUST WALKING? Land's sake, boy, I've got
something else to do!"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, that's too bad, isn't it?" David's face expressed sympathetic
regret. "And it's such a nice day! Maybe it'll rain by tomorrow."
</P>

<P>
"Maybe it will," retorted Mrs. Holly, with slightly uplifted eyebrows
and an expressive glance. "But whether it does or does n't won't make
any difference in my going to walk, I guess."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, won't it?" beamed David, his face changing. "I'm so glad! I don't
mind the rain, either. Father and I used to go in the rain lots of
times, only, of course, we couldn't take our violins then, so we used
to like the pleasant days better. But there are some things you find on
rainy days that you couldn't find any other time, aren't there? The
dance of the drops on the leaves, and the rush of the rain when the
wind gets behind it. Don't you love to feel it, out in the open spaces,
where the wind just gets a good chance to push?"
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Holly stared. Then she shivered and threw up her hands with a
gesture of hopeless abandonment.
</P>

<P>
"Land's sake, boy!" she ejaculated feebly, as she turned back to her
work.
</P>

<P>
From dishes to sweeping, and from sweeping to dusting, hurried Mrs.
Holly, going at last into the somber parlor, always carefully guarded
from sun and air. Watching her, mutely, David trailed behind, his eyes
staring a little as they fell upon the multitude of objects that parlor
contained: the haircloth chairs, the long sofa, the marble-topped
table, the curtains, cushions, spreads, and "throws," the innumerable
mats and tidies, the hair-wreath, the wax flowers under their glass
dome, the dried grasses, the marvelous bouquets of scarlet, green, and
purple everlastings, the stones and shells and many-sized, many-shaped
vases arranged as if in line of battle along the corner shelves.
</P>

<P>
"Y&mdash;yes, you may come in," called Mrs. Holly, glancing back at the
hesitating boy in the doorway. "But you mustn't touch anything. I'm
going to dust."
</P>

<P>
"But I haven't seen this room before," ruminated David.
</P>

<P>
"Well, no," deigned Mrs. Holly, with just a touch of superiority. "We
don't use this room common, little boy, nor the bedroom there, either.
This is the company room, for ministers and funerals, and&mdash;" She
stopped hastily, with a quick look at David; but the boy did not seem
to have heard.
</P>

<P>
"And doesn't anybody live here in this house, but just you and Mr.
Holly, and Mr. Perry Larson?" he asked, still looking wonderingly about
him.
</P>

<P>
"No, not&mdash;now." Mrs. Holly drew in her breath with a little catch, and
glanced at the framed portrait of a little boy on the wall.
</P>

<P>
"But you've got such a lot of rooms and&mdash;and things," remarked David.
"Why, daddy and I only had two rooms, and not hardly any THINGS. It was
so&mdash;different, you know, in my home."
</P>

<P>
"I should say it might have been!" Mrs. Holly began to dust hurriedly,
but carefully. Her voice still carried its hint of superiority.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, yes," smiled David. "But you say you don't use this room much, so
that helps."
</P>

<P>
"Helps!" In her stupefaction Mrs. Holly stopped her work and stared.
</P>

<P>
"Why, yes. I mean, you've got so many other rooms you can live in
those. You don't HAVE to live in here."
</P>

<P>
"'Have to live in here'!" ejaculated the woman, still too
uncomprehending to be anything but amazed.
</P>

<P>
"Yes. But do you have to KEEP all these things, and clean them and
clean them, like this, every day? Couldn't you give them to somebody,
or throw them away?"
</P>

<P>
"Throw&mdash;these&mdash;things&mdash;away!" With a wild sweep of her arms, the
horrified woman seemed to be trying to encompass in a protective
embrace each last endangered treasure of mat and tidy. "Boy, are you
crazy? These things are&mdash;are valuable. They cost money, and time
and&mdash;and labor. Don't you know beautiful things when you see them?"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, yes, I love BEAUTIFUL things," smiled David, with unconsciously
rude emphasis. "And up on the mountain I had them always. There was the
sunrise, and the sunset, and the moon and the stars, and my Silver
Lake, and the cloud-boats that sailed&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
But Mrs. Holly, with a vexed gesture, stopped him.
</P>

<P>
"Never mind, little boy. I might have known&mdash;brought up as you have
been. Of course you could not appreciate such things as these. Throw
them away, indeed!" And she fell to work again; but this time her
fingers carried a something in their touch that was almost like the
caress a mother might bestow upon an aggrieved child.
</P>

<P>
David, vaguely disturbed and uncomfortable, watched her with troubled
eyes; then, apologetically, he explained:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"It was only that I thought if you didn't have to clean so many of
these things, you could maybe go to walk more&mdash;to-day, and other days,
you know. You said&mdash;you didn't have time," he reminded her.
</P>

<P>
But Mrs. Holly only shook her head and sighed:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"Well, well, never mind, little boy. I dare say you meant all right.
You couldn't understand, of course."
</P>

<P>
And David, after another moment's wistful eyeing of the caressing
fingers, turned about and wandered out onto the side porch. A minute
later, having seated himself on the porch steps, he had taken from his
pocket two small pieces of folded paper. And then, through tear-dimmed
eyes, he read once more his father's letter.
</P>

<P>
"He said I mustn't grieve, for that would grieve him," murmured the
boy, after a time, his eyes on the far-away hills. "And he said if I'd
play, my mountains would come to me here, and I'd really be at home up
there. He said in my violin were all those things I'm wanting&mdash;so bad!"
</P>

<P>
With a little choking breath, David tucked the note back into his
pocket and reached for his violin.
</P>

<P>
Some time later, Mrs. Holly, dusting the chairs in the parlor, stopped
her work, tiptoed to the door, and listened breathlessly. When she
turned back, still later, to her work, her eyes were wet.
</P>

<P>
"I wonder why, when he plays, I always get to thinking of&mdash;John," she
sighed to herself, as she picked up her dusting-cloth.
</P>

<P>
After supper that night, Simeon Holly and his wife again sat on the
kitchen porch, resting from the labor of the day. Simeon's eyes were
closed. His wife's were on the dim outlines of the shed, the barn, the
road, or a passing horse and wagon. David, sitting on the steps, was
watching the moon climb higher and higher above the tree-tops. After a
time he slipped into the house and came out with his violin.
</P>

<P>
At the first long-drawn note of sweetness, Simeon Holly opened his eyes
and sat up, stern-lipped. But his wife laid a timid hand on his arm.
</P>

<P>
"Don't say anything, please," she entreated softly. "Let him play, just
for to-night. He's lonesome&mdash;poor little fellow." And Simeon Holly,
with a frowning shrug of his shoulders, sat back in his chair.
</P>

<P>
Later, it was Mrs. Holly herself who stopped the music by saying:
"Come, David, it's bedtime for little boys. I'll go upstairs with you."
And she led the way into the house and lighted the candle for him.
</P>

<P>
Upstairs, in the little room over the kitchen, David found himself once
more alone. As before, the little yellow-white nightshirt lay over the
chair-back; and as before, Mrs. Holly had brushed away a tear as she
had placed it there. As before, too, the big four-posted bed loomed
tall and formidable in the corner. But this time the coverlet and sheet
were turned back invitingly&mdash;Mrs. Holly had been much disturbed to find
that David had slept on the floor the night before.
</P>

<P>
Once more, with his back carefully turned toward the impaled bugs and
moths on the wall, David undressed himself. Then, before blowing out
the candle, he went to the window kneeled down, and looked up at the
moon through the trees.
</P>

<P>
David was sorely puzzled. He was beginning to wonder just what was to
become of himself.
</P>

<P>
His father had said that out in the world there was a beautiful work
for him to do; but what was it? How was he to find it? Or how was he to
do it if he did find it? And another thing; where was he to live? Could
he stay where he was? It was not home, to be sure; but there was the
little room over the kitchen where he might sleep, and there was the
kind woman who smiled at him sometimes with the sad, far-away look in
her eyes that somehow hurt. He would not like, now, to leave her&mdash;with
daddy gone.
</P>

<P>
There were the gold-pieces, too; and concerning these David was equally
puzzled. What should he do with them? He did not need them&mdash;the kind
woman was giving him plenty of food, so that he did not have to go to
the store and buy; and there was nothing else, apparently, that he
could use them for. They were heavy, and disagreeable to carry; yet he
did not like to throw them away, nor to let anybody know that he had
them: he had been called a thief just for one little piece, and what
would they say if they knew he had all those others?
</P>

<P>
David remembered now, suddenly, that his father had said to hide
them&mdash;to hide them until he needed them. David was relieved at once.
Why had he not thought of it before? He knew just the place, too,&mdash;the
little cupboard behind the chimney there in this very room! And with a
satisfied sigh, David got to his feet, gathered all the little yellow
disks from his pockets, and tucked them well out of sight behind the
piles of books on the cupboard shelves. There, too, he hid the watch;
but the little miniature of the angel-mother he slipped back into one
of his pockets.
</P>

<P>
David's second morning at the farmhouse was not unlike the first,
except that this time, when Simeon Holly asked him to fill the woodbox,
David resolutely ignored every enticing bug and butterfly, and kept
rigorously to the task before him until it was done.
</P>

<P>
He was in the kitchen when, just before dinner, Perry Larson came into
the room with a worried frown on his face.
</P>

<P>
"Mis' Holly, would ye mind just steppin' to the side door? There's a
woman an' a little boy there, an' somethin' ails 'em. She can't talk
English, an' I'm blest if I can make head nor tail out of the lingo she
DOES talk. But maybe you can."
</P>

<P>
"Why, Perry, I don't know&mdash;" began Mrs. Holly. But she turned at once
toward the door.
</P>

<P>
On the porch steps stood a very pretty, but frightened-looking young
woman with a boy perhaps ten years old at her side. Upon catching sight
of Mrs. Holly she burst into a torrent of unintelligible words,
supplemented by numerous and vehement gestures.
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Holly shrank back, and cast appealing eyes toward her husband who
at that moment had come across the yard from the barn.
</P>

<P>
"Simeon, can you tell what she wants?"
</P>

<P>
At sight of the newcomer on the scene, the strange woman began again,
with even more volubility.
</P>

<P>
"No," said Simeon Holly, after a moment's scowling scrutiny of the
gesticulating woman. "She's talking French, I think. And she
wants&mdash;something."
</P>

<P>
"Gosh! I should say she did," muttered Perry Larson. "An' whatever 't
is, she wants it powerful bad."
</P>

<P>
"Are you hungry?" questioned Mrs. Holly timidly.
</P>

<P>
"Can't you speak English at all?" demanded Simeon Holly.
</P>

<P>
The woman looked from one to the other with the piteous, pleading eyes
of the stranger in the strange land who cannot understand or make
others understand. She had turned away with a despairing shake of her
head, when suddenly she gave a wild cry of joy and wheeled about, her
whole face alight.
</P>

<P>
The Hollys and Perry Larson saw then that David had come out onto the
porch and was speaking to the woman&mdash;and his words were just as
unintelligible as the woman's had been.
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Holly and Perry Larson stared. Simeon Holly interrupted David with
a sharp:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"Do you, then, understand this woman, boy?"
</P>

<P>
"Why, yes! Didn't you? She's lost her way, and&mdash;" But the woman had
hurried forward and was pouring her story into David's ears.
</P>

<P>
At its conclusion David turned to find the look of stupefaction still
on the others' faces.
</P>

<P>
"Well, what does she want?" asked Simeon Holly crisply.
</P>

<P>
"She wants to find the way to Francois Lavelle's house. He's her
husband's brother. She came in on the train this morning. Her husband
stopped off a minute somewhere, she says, and got left behind. He could
talk English, but she can't. She's only been in this country a week.
She came from France."
</P>

<P>
"Gorry! Won't ye listen ter that, now?" cried Perry Larson admiringly.
"Reads her just like a book, don't he? There's a French family over in
West Hinsdale&mdash;two of 'em, I think. What'll ye bet 't ain't one o'
them?"
</P>

<P>
"Very likely," acceded Simeon Holly, his eyes bent disapprovingly on
David's face. It was plain to be seen that Simeon Holly's attention was
occupied by David, not the woman.
</P>

<P>
"An', say, Mr. Holly," resumed Perry Larson, a little excitedly, "you
know I was goin' over ter West Hinsdale in a day or two ter see Harlow
about them steers. Why can't I go this afternoon an' tote her an' the
kid along?"
</P>

<P>
"Very well," nodded Simeon Holly curtly, his eyes still on David's face.
</P>

<P>
Perry Larson turned to the woman, and by a flourish of his arms and a
jumble of broken English attempted to make her understand that he was
to take her where she undoubtedly wished to go. The woman still looked
uncomprehending, however, and David promptly came to the rescue, saying
a few rapid words that quickly brought a flood of delighted
understanding to the woman's face.
</P>

<P>
"Can't you ask her if she's hungry?" ventured Mrs. Holly, then.
</P>

<P>
"She says no, thank you," translated David, with a smile, when he had
received his answer. "But the boy says he is, if you please."
</P>

<P>
"Then, tell them to come into the kitchen," directed Mrs. Holly,
hurrying into the house.
</P>

<P>
"So you're French, are you?" said Simeon Holly to David.
</P>

<P>
"French? Oh, no, sir," smiled David, proudly. "I'm an American. Father
said I was. He said I was born in this country."
</P>

<P>
"But how comes it you can speak French like that?"
</P>

<P>
"Why, I learned it." Then, divining that his words were still
unconvincing, he added: "Same as I learned German and other things with
father, out of books, you know. Didn't you learn French when you were a
little boy?"
</P>

<P>
"Humph!" vouchsafed Simeon Holly, stalking away without answering the
question.
</P>

<P>
Immediately after dinner Perry Larson drove away with the woman and the
little boy. The woman's face was wreathed with smiles, and her last
adoring glance was for David, waving his hand to her from the porch
steps.
</P>

<P>
In the afternoon David took his violin and went off toward the hill
behind the house for a walk. He had asked Mrs. Holly to accompany him,
but she had refused, though she was not sweeping or dusting at the
time. She was doing nothing more important, apparently, than making
holes in a piece of white cloth, and sewing them up again with a needle
and thread.
</P>

<P>
David had then asked Mr. Holly to go; but his refusal was even more
strangely impatient than his wife's had been.
</P>

<P>
"And why, pray, should I go for a useless walk now&mdash;or any time, for
that matter?" he demanded sharply.
</P>

<P>
David had shrunk back unconsciously, though he had still smiled.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, but it wouldn't be a useless walk, sir. Father said nothing was
useless that helped to keep us in tune, you know."
</P>

<P>
"In tune!"
</P>

<P>
"I mean, you looked as father used to look sometimes, when he felt out
of tune. And he always said there was nothing like a walk to put him
back again. I&mdash;I was feeling a little out of tune myself to-day, and I
thought, by the way you looked, that you were, too.  So I asked you to
go to walk."
</P>

<P>
"Humph! Well, I&mdash;That will do, boy. No impertinence, you understand!"
And he had turned away in very obvious anger.
</P>

<P>
David, with a puzzled sorrow in his heart had started alone then, on
his walk.

CHAPTER VII
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
"YOU'RE WANTED&mdash;YOU'RE WANTED!"
</H3>

<P>
It was Saturday night, and the end of David's third day at the
farmhouse. Upstairs, in the hot little room over the kitchen, the boy
knelt at the window and tried to find a breath of cool air from the
hills. Downstairs on the porch Simeon Holly and his wife discussed the
events of the past few days, and talked of what should be done with
David.
</P>

<P>
"But what shall we do with him?" moaned Mrs. Holly at last, breaking a
long silence that had fallen between them. "What can we do with him?
Doesn't anybody want him?"
</P>

<P>
"No, of course, nobody wants him," retorted her husband relentlessly.
</P>

<P>
And at the words a small figure in a yellow-white nightshirt stopped
short. David, violin in hand, had fled from the little hot room, and
stood now just inside the kitchen door.
</P>

<P>
"Who can want a child that has been brought up in that heathenish
fashion?" continued Simeon Holly. "According to his own story, even his
father did nothing but play the fiddle and tramp through the woods day
in and day out, with an occasional trip to the mountain village to get
food and clothing when they had absolutely nothing to eat and wear. Of
course nobody wants him!"
</P>

<P>
David, at the kitchen door, caught his breath chokingly. Then he sped
across the floor to the back hall, and on through the long sheds to the
hayloft in the barn&mdash;the place where his father seemed always nearest.
</P>

<P>
David was frightened and heartsick. NOBODY WANTED HIM. He had heard it
with his own ears, so there was no mistake. What now about all those
long days and nights ahead before he might go, violin in hand, to meet
his father in that far-away country? How was he to live those days and
nights if nobody wanted him? How was his violin to speak in a voice
that was true and pure and full, and tell of the beautiful world, as
his father had said that it must do? David quite cried aloud at the
thought. Then he thought of something else that his father had said:
"Remember this, my boy,&mdash;in your violin lie all the things you long
for. You have only to play, and the broad skies of your mountain home
will be over you, and the dear friends and comrades of your mountain
forests will be all about you."  With a quick cry David raised his
violin and drew the bow across the strings.
</P>

<P>
Back on the porch at that moment Mrs. Holly was saying:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"Of course there's the orphan asylum, or maybe the poorhouse&mdash;if they'd
take him; but&mdash;Simeon," she broke off sharply, "where's that child
playing now?"
</P>

<P>
Simeon listened with intent ears.
</P>

<P>
"In the barn, I should say."
</P>

<P>
"But he'd gone to bed!"
</P>

<P>
"And he'll go to bed again," asserted Simeon Holly grimly, as he rose
to his feet and stalked across the moonlit yard to the barn.
</P>

<P>
As before, Mrs. Holly followed him, and as before, both involuntarily
paused just inside the barn door to listen. No runs and trills and
rollicking bits of melody floated down the stairway to-night. The notes
were long-drawn, and plaintively sweet; and they rose and swelled and
died almost into silence while the man and the woman by the door stood
listening.
</P>

<P>
They were back in the long ago&mdash;Simeon Holly and his wife&mdash;back with a
boy of their own who had made those same rafters ring with shouts of
laughter, and who, also, had played the violin&mdash;though not like this;
and the same thought had come to each: "What if, after all, it were
John playing all alone in the moonlight!"
</P>

<P>
It had not been the violin, in the end, that had driven John Holly from
home. It had been the possibilities in a piece of crayon. All through
childhood the boy had drawn his beloved "pictures" on every inviting
space that offered,&mdash;whether it were the "best-room" wall-paper, or the
fly leaf of the big plush album,&mdash;and at eighteen he had announced his
determination to be an artist. For a year after that Simeon Holly
fought with all the strength of a stubborn will, banished chalk and
crayon from the house, and set the boy to homely tasks that left no
time for anything but food and sleep&mdash;then John ran away.
</P>

<P>
That was fifteen years ago, and they had not seen him since; though two
unanswered letters in Simeon Holly's desk testified that perhaps this,
at least, was not the boy's fault.
</P>

<P>
It was not of the grown-up John, the willful boy and runaway son,
however, that Simeon Holly and his wife were thinking, as they stood
just inside the barn door; it was of Baby John, the little curly-headed
fellow that had played at their knees, frolicked in this very barn, and
nestled in their arms when the day was done.
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Holly spoke first&mdash;and it was not as she had spoken on the porch.
</P>

<P>
"Simeon," she began tremulously, "that dear child must go to bed!" And
she hurried across the floor and up the stairs, followed by her
husband. "Come, David," she said, as she reached the top; "it's time
little boys were asleep! Come!"
</P>

<P>
Her voice was low, and not quite steady. To David her voice sounded as
her eyes looked when there was in them the far-away something that
hurt. Very slowly he came forward into the moonlight, his gaze
searching the woman's face long and earnestly.
</P>

<P>
"And do you&mdash;want me?" he faltered.
</P>

<P>
The woman drew in her breath with a little sob. Before her stood the
slender figure in the yellow-white gown&mdash;John's gown. Into her eyes
looked those other eyes, dark and wistful,&mdash;like John's eyes. And her
arms ached with emptiness.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, yes, for my very own&mdash;and for always!" she cried with sudden
passion, clasping the little form close. "For always!"
</P>

<P>
And David sighed his content.
</P>

<P>
Simeon Holly's lips parted, but they closed again with no words said.
The man turned then, with a curiously baffled look, and stalked down
the stairs.
</P>

<P>
On the porch long minutes later, when once more David had gone to bed,
Simeon Holly said coldly to his wife:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"I suppose you realize, Ellen, just what you've pledged yourself to, by
that absurd outburst of yours in the barn to-night&mdash;and all because
that ungodly music and the moonshine had gone to your head!"
</P>

<P>
"But I want the boy, Simeon. He&mdash;he makes me think of&mdash;John."
</P>

<P>
Harsh lines came to the man's mouth, but there was a perceptible shake
in his voice as he answered:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"We're not talking of John, Ellen. We're talking of this irresponsible,
hardly sane boy upstairs. He can work, I suppose, if he's taught, and
in that way he won't perhaps be a dead loss. Still, he's another mouth
to feed, and that counts now. There's the note, you know,&mdash;it's due in
August."
</P>

<P>
"But you say there's money&mdash;almost enough for it&mdash;in the bank." Mrs.
Holly's voice was anxiously apologetic.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, I know" vouchsafed the man. "But almost enough is not quite
enough."
</P>

<P>
"But there's time&mdash;more than two months. It isn't due till the last of
August, Simeon."
</P>

<P>
"I know, I know. Meanwhile, there's the boy. What are you going to do
with him?"
</P>

<P>
"Why, can't you use him&mdash;on the farm&mdash;a little?"
</P>

<P>
"Perhaps. I doubt it, though," gloomed the man. "One can't hoe corn nor
pull weeds with a fiddle-bow&mdash;and that's all he seems to know how to
handle."
</P>

<P>
"But he can learn&mdash;and he does play beautifully," murmured the woman;
whenever before had Ellen Holly ventured to use words of argument with
her husband, and in extenuation, too, of an act of her own!
</P>

<P>
There was no reply except a muttered "Humph!" under the breath. Then
Simeon Holly rose and stalked into the house.
</P>

<P>
The next day was Sunday, and Sunday at the farmhouse was a thing of
stern repression and solemn silence. In Simeon Holly's veins ran the
blood of the Puritans, and he was more than strict as to what he
considered right and wrong. When half-trained for the ministry,
ill-health had forced him to resort to a less confining life, though
never had it taken from him the uncompromising rigor of his views. It
was a distinct shock to him, therefore, on this Sunday morning to be
awakened by a peal of music such as the little house had never known
before. All the while that he was thrusting his indignant self into his
clothing, the runs and turns and crashing chords whirled about him
until it seemed that a whole orchestra must be imprisoned in the little
room over the kitchen, so skillful was the boy's double stopping.
Simeon Holly was white with anger when he finally hurried down the hall
and threw open David's bedroom door.
</P>

<P>
"Boy, what do you mean by this?" he demanded.
</P>

<P>
David laughed gleefully.
</P>

<P>
"And didn't you know?" he asked. "Why, I thought my music would tell
you. I was so happy, so glad! The birds in the trees woke me up
singing, 'You're wanted&mdash;you're wanted;' and the sun came over the hill
there and said, 'You're wanted&mdash;you're wanted;' and the little
tree-branch tapped on my window pane and said 'You're wanted&mdash;you're
wanted!' And I just had to take up my violin and tell you about it!"
</P>

<P>
"But it's Sunday&mdash;the Lord's Day," remonstrated the man sternly.
</P>

<P>
David stood motionless, his eyes questioning.
</P>

<P>
"Are you quite a heathen, then?" catechised the man sharply. "Have they
never told you anything about God, boy?"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, 'God'?&mdash;of course," smiled David, in open relief. "God wraps up
the buds in their little brown blankets, and covers the roots with&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"I am not talking about brown blankets nor roots," interrupted the man
severely. "This is God's day, and as such should be kept holy."
</P>

<P>
"'Holy'?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes. You should not fiddle nor laugh nor sing."
</P>

<P>
"But those are good things, and beautiful things," defended David, his
eyes wide and puzzled.
</P>

<P>
"In their place, perhaps," conceded the man, stiffly, "but not on God's
day."
</P>

<P>
"You mean&mdash;He wouldn't like them?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes."
</P>

<P>
"Oh!"&mdash;and David's face cleared. "That's all right, then. Your God
isn't the same one, sir, for mine loves all beautiful things every day
in the year."
</P>

<P>
There was a moment's silence. For the first time in his life Simeon
Holly found himself without words.
</P>

<P>
"We won't talk of this any more, David," he said at last; "but we'll
put it another way&mdash;I don't wish you to play your fiddle on Sunday.
Now, put it up till to-morrow." And he turned and went down the hall.
</P>

<P>
Breakfast was a very quiet meal that morning. Meals were never things
of hilarious joy at the Holly farmhouse, as David had already found
out; but he had not seen one before quite so somber as this. It was
followed immediately by a half-hour of Scripture-reading and prayer,
with Mrs. Holly and Perry Larson sitting very stiff and solemn in their
chairs, while Mr. Holly read. David tried to sit very stiff and solemn
in his chair, also; but the roses at the window were nodding their
heads and beckoning; and the birds in the bushes beyond were sending to
him coaxing little chirps of "Come out, come out!" And how could one
expect to sit stiff and solemn in the face of all that, particularly
when one's fingers were tingling to take up the interrupted song of the
morning and tell the whole world how beautiful it was to be wanted!
</P>

<P>
Yet David sat very still,&mdash;or as still as he could sit,&mdash;and only the
tapping of his foot, and the roving of his wistful eyes told that his
mind was not with Farmer Holly and the Children of Israel in their
wanderings in the wilderness.
</P>

<P>
After the devotions came an hour of subdued haste and confusion while
the family prepared for church. David had never been to church. He
asked Perry Larson what it was like; but Perry only shrugged his
shoulders and said, to nobody, apparently:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"Sugar! Won't ye hear that, now?"&mdash;which to David was certainly no
answer at all.
</P>

<P>
That one must be spick and span to go to church, David soon found
out&mdash;never before had he been so scrubbed and brushed and combed. There
was, too, brought out for him to wear a little clean white blouse and a
red tie, over which Mrs. Holly cried a little as she had over the
nightshirt that first evening.
</P>

<P>
The church was in the village only a quarter of a mile away; and in due
time David, open-eyed and interested, was following Mr. and Mrs. Holly
down its long center aisle. The Hollys were early as usual, and service
had not begun. Even the organist had not taken his seat beneath the
great pipes of blue and gold that towered to the ceiling.
</P>

<P>
It was the pride of the town&mdash;that organ. It had been given by a great
man (out in the world) whose birthplace the town was. More than that, a
yearly donation from this same great man paid for the skilled organist
who came every Sunday from the city to play it. To-day, as the organist
took his seat, he noticed a new face in the Holly pew, and he almost
gave a friendly smile as he met the wondering gaze of the small boy
there; then he lost himself, as usual, in the music before him.
</P>

<P>
Down in the Holly pew the small boy held his breath. A score of violins
were singing in his ears; and a score of other instruments that he
could not name, crashed over his head, and brought him to his feet in
ecstasy. Before a detaining hand could stop him, he was out in the
aisle, his eyes on the blue-and-gold pipes from which seemed to come
those wondrous sounds. Then his gaze fell on the man and on the banks
of keys; and with soft steps he crept along the aisle and up the stairs
to the organ-loft.
</P>

<P>
For long minutes he stood motionless, listening; then the music died
into silence and the minister rose for the invocation. It was a boy's
voice, and not a man's, however, that broke the pause.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, sir, please," it said, "would you&mdash;could you teach ME to do that?"
</P>

<P>
The organist choked over a cough, and the soprano reached out and drew
David to her side, whispering something in his ear. The minister, after
a dazed silence, bowed his head; while down in the Holly pew an angry
man and a sorely mortified woman vowed that, before David came to
church again, he should have learned some things.
</P>

CHAPTER VIII
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
THE PUZZLING "DOS" AND "DON'TS"
</H3>

<P>
With the coming of Monday arrived a new life for David&mdash;a curious life
full of "don'ts" and "dos." David wondered sometimes why all the
pleasant things were "don'ts" and all the unpleasant ones "dos." Corn
to be hoed, weeds to be pulled, woodboxes to be filled; with all these
it was "do this, do this, do this." But when it came to lying under the
apple trees, exploring the brook that ran by the field, or even
watching the bugs and worms that one found in the earth&mdash;all these were
"don'ts."
</P>

<P>
As to Farmer Holly&mdash;Farmer Holly himself awoke to some new experiences
that Monday morning. One of them was the difficulty in successfully
combating the cheerfully expressed opinion that weeds were so pretty
growing that it was a pity to pull them up and let them all wither and
die. Another was the equally great difficulty of keeping a small boy at
useful labor of any sort in the face of the attractions displayed by a
passing cloud, a blossoming shrub, or a bird singing on a tree-branch.
</P>

<P>
In spite of all this, however, David so evidently did his best to carry
out the "dos" and avoid the "don'ts," that at four o'clock that first
Monday he won from the stern but would-be-just Farmer Holly his freedom
for the rest of the day; and very gayly he set off for a walk. He went
without his violin, as there was the smell of rain in the air; but his
face and his step and the very swing of his arms were singing (to
David) the joyous song of the morning before. Even yet, in spite of the
vicissitudes of the day's work, the whole world, to David's homesick,
lonely little heart, was still caroling that blessed "You're wanted,
you're wanted, you're wanted!"
</P>

<P>
And then he saw the crow.
</P>

<P>
David knew crows. In his home on the mountain he had had several of
them for friends. He had learned to know and answer their calls. He had
learned to admire their wisdom and to respect their moods and tempers.
He loved to watch them. Especially he loved to see the great birds cut
through the air with a wide sweep of wings, so alive, so gloriously
free!
</P>

<P>
But this crow&mdash;
</P>

<P>
This crow was not cutting through the air with a wide sweep of wing. It
was in the middle of a cornfield, and it was rising and falling and
flopping about in a most extraordinary fashion. Very soon David,
running toward it, saw why. By a long leather strip it was fastened
securely to a stake in the ground.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, oh, oh!" exclaimed David, in sympathetic consternation. "Here, you
just wait a minute. I'll fix it."
</P>

<P>
With confident celerity David whipped out his jackknife to cut the
thong; but he found then that to "fix it" and to say he would "fix it"
were two different matters.
</P>

<P>
The crow did not seem to recognize in David a friend. He saw in him,
apparently, but another of the stone-throwing, gun-shooting, torturing
humans who were responsible for his present hateful captivity. With
beak and claw and wing, therefore, he fought this new evil that had
come presumedly to torment; and not until David had hit upon the
expedient of taking off his blouse, and throwing it over the angry
bird, could the boy get near enough to accomplish his purpose. Even
then David had to leave upon the slender leg a twist of leather.
</P>

<P>
A moment later, with a whir of wings and a frightened squawk that
quickly turned into a surprised caw of triumphant rejoicing, the crow
soared into the air and made straight for a distant tree-top. David,
after a minute's glad surveying of his work, donned his blouse again
and resumed his walk.
</P>

<P>
It was almost six o'clock when David got back to the Holly farmhouse.
In the barn doorway sat Perry Larson.
</P>

<P>
"Well, sonny," the man greeted him cheerily, "did ye get yer weedin'
done?"
</P>

<P>
"Y&mdash;yes," hesitated David. "I got it done; but I didn't like it."
</P>

<P>
"'T is kinder hot work."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, I didn't mind that part," returned David. "What I didn't like was
pulling up all those pretty little plants and letting them die."
</P>

<P>
"Weeds&mdash;'pretty little plants'!" ejaculated the man. "Well, I'll be
jiggered!"
</P>

<P>
"But they WERE pretty," defended David, reading aright the scorn in
Perry Larson's voice. "The very prettiest and biggest there were,
always. Mr. Holly showed me, you know,&mdash;and I had to pull them up."
</P>

<P>
"Well, I'll be jiggered!" muttered Perry Larson again.
</P>

<P>
"But I've been to walk since. I feel better now."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, ye do!"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, yes. I had a splendid walk. I went 'way up in the woods on the
hill there. I was singing all the time&mdash;inside, you know. I was so glad
Mrs. Holly&mdash;wanted me. You know what it is, when you sing inside."
</P>

<P>
Perry Larson scratched his head.
</P>

<P>
"Well, no, sonny, I can't really say I do," he retorted. "I ain't much
on singin'."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, but I don't mean aloud. I mean inside. When you're happy, you
know."
</P>

<P>
"When I'm&mdash;oh!" The man stopped and stared, his mouth falling open.
Suddenly his face changed, and he grinned appreciatively. "Well, if you
ain't the beat 'em, boy! 'T is kinder like singin'&mdash;the way ye feel
inside, when yer 'specially happy, ain't it? But I never thought of it
before."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, yes. Why, that's where I get my songs&mdash;inside of me, you
know&mdash;that I play on my violin. And I made a crow sing, too. Only HE
sang outside."
</P>

<P>
"SING&mdash;A CROW!" scoffed the man. "Shucks! It'll take more 'n you ter
make me think a crow can sing, my lad."
</P>

<P>
"But they do, when they're happy," maintained the boy. "Anyhow, it
doesn't sound the same as it does when they're cross, or plagued over
something. You ought to have heard this one to-day. He sang. He was so
glad to get away. I let him loose, you see."
</P>

<P>
"You mean, you CAUGHT a crow up there in them woods?" The man's voice
was skeptical.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, no, I didn't catch it. But somebody had, and tied him up. And he
was so unhappy!"
</P>

<P>
"A crow tied up in the woods!"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, I didn't find THAT in the woods. It was before I went up the hill
at all."
</P>

<P>
"A crow tied up&mdash;Look a-here, boy, what are you talkin' about? Where
was that crow?" Perry Larson's whole self had become suddenly alert.
</P>

<P>
"In the field 'Way over there. And somebody&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"The cornfield! Jingo! Boy, you don't mean you touched THAT crow?"
</P>

<P>
"Well, he wouldn't let me TOUCH him," half-apologized David. "He was so
afraid, you see. Why, I had to put my blouse over his head before he'd
let me cut him loose at all."
</P>

<P>
"Cut him loose!" Perry Larson sprang to his feet. "You did n't&mdash;you
DIDn't let that crow go!"
</P>

<P>
David shrank back.
</P>

<P>
"Why, yes; he WANTED to go. He&mdash;" But the man before him had fallen
back despairingly to his old position.
</P>

<P>
"Well, sir, you've done it now. What the boss'll say, I don't know; but
I know what I'd like ter say to ye. I was a whole week, off an' on,
gettin' hold of that crow, an' I wouldn't have got him at all if I
hadn't hid half the night an' all the mornin' in that clump o' bushes,
watchin' a chance ter wing him, jest enough an' not too much. An' even
then the job wa'n't done. Let me tell yer, 't wa'n't no small thing ter
get him hitched. I'm wearin' the marks of the rascal's beak yet. An'
now you've gone an' let him go&mdash;just like that," he finished, snapping
his fingers angrily.
</P>

<P>
In David's face there was no contrition. There was only incredulous
horror.
</P>

<P>
"You mean, YOU tied him there, on purpose?"
</P>

<P>
"Sure I did!"
</P>

<P>
"But he didn't like it. Couldn't you see he didn't like it?" cried
David.
</P>

<P>
"Like it! What if he didn't? I didn't like ter have my corn pulled up,
either. See here, sonny, you no need ter look at me in that tone o'
voice. I didn't hurt the varmint none ter speak of&mdash;ye see he could
fly, didn't ye?&mdash;an' he wa'n't starvin'. I saw to it that he had enough
ter eat an' a dish o' water handy. An' if he didn't flop an' pull an'
try ter get away he needn't 'a' hurt hisself never. I ain't ter blame
for what pullin' he done."
</P>

<P>
"But wouldn't you pull if you had two big wings that could carry you to
the top of that big tree there, and away up, up in the sky, where you
could talk to the stars?&mdash;wouldn't you pull if somebody a hundred times
bigger'n you came along and tied your leg to that post there?"
</P>

<P>
The man, Perry, flushed an angry red.
</P>

<P>
"See here, sonny, I wa'n't askin' you ter do no preachin'. What I did
ain't no more'n any man 'round here does&mdash;if he's smart enough ter
catch one. Rigged-up broomsticks ain't in it with a live bird when it
comes ter drivin' away them pesky, thievin' crows. There ain't a farmer
'round here that hain't been green with envy, ever since I caught the
critter. An' now ter have you come along an' with one flip o'yer knife
spile it all, I&mdash;Well, it jest makes me mad, clean through! That's all."
</P>

<P>
"You mean, you tied him there to frighten away the other crows?"
</P>

<P>
"Sure! There ain't nothin' like it."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, I'm so sorry!"
</P>

<P>
"Well, you'd better be. But that won't bring back my crow!"
</P>

<P>
David's face brightened.
</P>

<P>
"No, that's so, isn't it? I'm glad of that. I was thinking of the
crows, you see. I'm so sorry for them! Only think how we'd hate to be
tied like that&mdash;" But Perry Larson, with a stare and an indignant
snort, had got to his feet, and was rapidly walking toward the house.
</P>

<P>
Very plainly, that evening, David was in disgrace, and it took all of
Mrs. Holly's tact and patience, and some private pleading, to keep a
general explosion from wrecking all chances of his staying longer at
the farmhouse. Even as it was, David was sorrowfully aware that he was
proving to be a great disappointment so soon, and his violin playing
that evening carried a moaning plaintiveness that would have been very
significant to one who knew David well.
</P>

<P>
Very faithfully, the next day, the boy tried to carry out all the
"dos," and though he did not always succeed, yet his efforts were so
obvious, that even the indignant owner of the liberated crow was
somewhat mollified; and again Simeon Holly released David from work at
four o'clock.
</P>

<P>
Alas, for David's peace of mind, however; for on his walk to-day,
though he found no captive crow to demand his sympathy, he found
something else quite as heartrending, and as incomprehensible.
</P>

<P>
It was on the edge of the woods that he came upon two boys, each
carrying a rifle, a dead squirrel, and a dead rabbit. The threatened
rain of the day before had not materialized, and David had his violin.
He had been playing softly when he came upon the boys where the path
entered the woods.
</P>

<P>
"Oh!" At sight of the boys and their burden David gave an involuntary
cry, and stopped playing.
</P>

<P>
The boys, scarcely less surprised at sight of David and his violin,
paused and stared frankly.
</P>

<P>
"It's the tramp kid with his fiddle," whispered one to the other
huskily.
</P>

<P>
David, his grieved eyes on the motionless little bodies in the boys'
hands, shuddered.
</P>

<P>
"Are they&mdash;dead, too?"
</P>

<P>
The bigger boy nodded self-importantly.
</P>

<P>
"Sure. We just shot 'em&mdash;the squirrels. Ben here trapped the rabbits."
He paused, manifestly waiting for the proper awed admiration to come
into David's face.
</P>

<P>
But in David's startled eyes there was no awed admiration, there was
only disbelieving horror.
</P>

<P>
"You mean, you SENT them to the far country?"
</P>

<P>
"We&mdash;what?"
</P>

<P>
"Sent them. Made them go yourselves&mdash;to the far country?"
</P>

<P>
The younger boy still stared. The older one grinned disagreeably.
</P>

<P>
"Sure," he answered with laconic indifference. "We sent 'em to the far
country, all right."
</P>

<P>
"But&mdash;how did you know they WANTED to go?"
</P>

<P>
"Wanted&mdash;Eh?" exploded the big boy. Then he grinned again, still more
disagreeably. "Well, you see, my dear, we didn't ask 'em," he gibed.
</P>

<P>
Real distress came into David's face.
</P>

<P>
"Then you don't know at all. And maybe they DIDn't want to go. And if
they didn't, how COULD they go singing, as father said? Father wasn't
sent. He WENT. And he went singing. He said he did. But these&mdash;How
would YOU like to have somebody come along and send YOU to the far
country, without even knowing if you wanted to go?"
</P>

<P>
There was no answer. The boys, with a growing fear in their eyes, as at
sight of something inexplicable and uncanny, were sidling away; and in
a moment they were hurrying down the hill, not, however, without a
backward glance or two, of something very like terror.
</P>

<P>
David, left alone, went on his way with troubled eyes and a thoughtful
frown.
</P>

<P>
David often wore, during those first few days at the Holly farmhouse, a
thoughtful face and a troubled frown. There were so many, many things
that were different from his mountain home. Over and over, as those
first long days passed, he read his letter until he knew it by
heart&mdash;and he had need to. Was he not already surrounded by things and
people that were strange to him?
</P>

<P>
And they were so very strange&mdash;these people! There were the boys and
men who rose at dawn&mdash;yet never paused to watch the sun flood the world
with light; who stayed in the fields all day&mdash;yet never raised their
eyes to the big fleecy clouds overhead; who knew birds only as thieves
after fruit and grain, and squirrels and rabbits only as creatures to
be trapped or shot. The women&mdash;they were even more incomprehensible.
They spent the long hours behind screened doors and windows, washing
the same dishes and sweeping the same floors day after day. They, too,
never raised their eyes to the blue sky outside, nor even to the
crimson roses that peeped in at the window. They seemed rather to be
looking always for dirt, yet not pleased when they found it&mdash;especially
if it had been tracked in on the heel of a small boy's shoe!
</P>

<P>
More extraordinary than all this to David, however, was the fact that
these people regarded HIM, not themselves, as being strange. As if it
were not the most natural thing in the world to live with one's father
in one's home on the mountain-top, and spend one's days trailing
through the forest paths, or lying with a book beside some babbling
little stream! As if it were not equally natural to take one's violin
with one at times, and learn to catch upon the quivering strings the
whisper of the winds through the trees! Even in winter, when the clouds
themselves came down from the sky and covered the earth with their soft
whiteness,&mdash;even then the forest was beautiful; and the song of the
brook under its icy coat carried a charm and mystery that were quite
wanting in the chattering freedom of summer. Surely there was nothing
strange in all this, and yet these people seemed to think there was!

JOE
</H3>

<P>
Day by day, however, as time passed, David diligently tried to perform
the "dos" and avoid the "don'ts"; and day by day he came to realize how
important weeds and woodboxes were, if he were to conform to what was
evidently Farmer Holly's idea of "playing in, tune" in this strange new
Orchestra of Life in which he found himself.
</P>

<P>
But, try as he would, there was yet an unreality about it all, a
persistent feeling of uselessness and waste, that would not be set
aside. So that, after all, the only part of this strange new life of
his that seemed real to him was the time that came after four o'clock
each day, when he was released from work.
</P>

<P>
And how full he filled those hours! There was so much to see, so much
to do. For sunny days there were field and stream and pasture land and
the whole wide town to explore. For rainy days, if he did not care to
go to walk, there was his room with the books in the chimney cupboard.
Some of them David had read before, but many of them he had not. One or
two were old friends; but not so "Dare Devil Dick," and "The Pirates of
Pigeon Cove" (which he found hidden in an obscure corner behind a loose
board). Side by side stood "The Lady of the Lake," "Treasure Island,"
and "David Copperfield"; and coverless and dogeared lay "Robinson
Crusoe," "The Arabian Nights," and "Grimm's Fairy Tales." There were
more, many more, and David devoured them all with eager eyes. The good
in them he absorbed as he absorbed the sunshine; the evil he cast aside
unconsciously&mdash;it rolled off, indeed, like the proverbial water from
the duck's back.
</P>

<P>
David hardly knew sometimes which he liked the better, his imaginative
adventures between the covers of his books or his real adventures in
his daily strolls. True, it was not his mountain home&mdash;this place in
which he found himself; neither was there anywhere his Silver Lake with
its far, far-reaching sky above. More deplorable yet, nowhere was there
the dear father he loved so well. But the sun still set in rose and
gold, and the sky, though small, still carried the snowy sails of its
cloud-boats; while as to his father&mdash;his father had told him not to
grieve, and David was trying very hard to obey.
</P>

<P>
With his violin for company David started out each day, unless he
elected to stay indoors with his books. Sometimes it was toward the
village that he turned his steps; sometimes it was toward the hills
back of the town. Whichever way it was, there was always sure to be
something waiting at the end for him and his violin to discover, if it
was nothing more than a big white rose in bloom, or a squirrel sitting
by the roadside.
</P>

<P>
Very soon, however, David discovered that there was something to be
found in his wanderings besides squirrels and roses; and that
was&mdash;people. In spite of the strangeness of these people, they were
wonderfully interesting, David thought. And after that he turned his
steps more and more frequently toward the village when four o'clock
released him from the day's work.
</P>

<P>
At first David did not talk much to these people. He shrank sensitively
from their bold stares and unpleasantly audible comments. He watched
them with round eyes of wonder and interest, however,&mdash;when he did not
think they were watching him. And in time he came to know not a little
about them and about the strange ways in which they passed their time.
</P>

<P>
There was the greenhouse man. It would be pleasant to spend one's day
growing plants and flowers&mdash;but not under that hot, stifling glass
roof, decided David. Besides, he would not want always to pick and send
away the very prettiest ones to the city every morning, as the
greenhouse man did.
</P>

<P>
There was the doctor who rode all day long behind the gray mare, making
sick folks well. David liked him, and mentally vowed that he himself
would be a doctor sometime. Still, there was the stage-driver&mdash;David
was not sure but he would prefer to follow this man's profession for a
life-work; for in his, one could still have the freedom of long days in
the open, and yet not be saddened by the sight of the sick before they
had been made well&mdash;which was where the stage-driver had the better of
the doctor, in David's opinion. There were the blacksmith and the
storekeepers, too, but to these David gave little thought or attention.
</P>

<P>
Though he might not know what he did want to do, he knew very well what
he did not. All of which merely goes to prove that David was still on
the lookout for that great work which his father had said was waiting
for him out in the world.
</P>

<P>
Meanwhile David played his violin. If he found a crimson rambler in
bloom in a door-yard, he put it into a little melody of pure
delight&mdash;that a woman in the house behind the rambler heard the music
and was cheered at her task, David did not know. If he found a kitten
at play in the sunshine, he put it into a riotous abandonment of
tumbling turns and trills&mdash;that a fretful baby heard and stopped its
wailing, David also did not know. And once, just because the sky was
blue and the air was sweet, and it was so good to be alive, David
lifted his bow and put it all into a rapturous paean of ringing
exultation&mdash;that a sick man in a darkened chamber above the street
lifted his head, drew in his breath, and took suddenly a new lease of
life, David still again did not know. All of which merely goes to prove
that David had perhaps found his work and was doing it&mdash;although yet
still again David did not know.
</P>

<P>
It was in the cemetery one afternoon that David came upon the Lady in
Black. She was on her knees putting flowers on a little mound before
her. She looked up as David approached. For a moment she gazed
wistfully at him; then as if impelled by a hidden force, she spoke.
</P>

<P>
"Little boy, who are you?"
</P>

<P>
"I'm David."
</P>

<P>
"David! David who? Do you live here? I've seen you here before."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, yes, I've been here quite a lot of times." Purposely the boy
evaded the questions. David was getting tired of questions&mdash;especially
these questions.
</P>

<P>
"And have you&mdash;lost one dear to you, little boy?"
</P>

<P>
"Lost some one?"
</P>

<P>
"I mean&mdash;is your father or mother&mdash;here?"
</P>

<P>
 "Here? Oh, no, they aren't here. My mother is an angel-mother,<BR>
and my father has gone to the far country. He is waiting for me there,
you know."
</P>

<P>
"But, that's the same&mdash;that is&mdash;" She stopped helplessly, bewildered
eyes on David's serene face. Then suddenly a great light came to her
own. "Oh, little boy, I wish I could understand that&mdash;just that," she
breathed. "It would make it so much easier&mdash;if I could just remember
that they aren't here&mdash;that they're WAITING&mdash;over there!"
</P>

<P>
But David apparently did not hear. He had turned and was playing softly
as he walked away. Silently the Lady in Black knelt, listening, looking
after him. When she rose some time later and left the cemetery, the
light on her face was still there, deeper, more glorified.
</P>

<P>
Toward boys and girls&mdash;especially boys&mdash;of his own age, David
frequently turned wistful eyes. David wanted a friend, a friend who
would know and understand; a friend who would see things as he saw
them, who would understand what he was saying when he played. It seemed
to David that in some boy of his own age he ought to find such a
friend. He had seen many boys&mdash;but he had not yet found the friend.
David had begun to think, indeed, that of all these strange beings in
this new life of his, boys were the strangest.
</P>

<P>
They stared and nudged each other unpleasantly when they came upon him
playing. They jeered when he tried to tell them what he had been
playing. They had never heard of the great Orchestra of Life, and they
fell into most disconcerting fits of laughter, or else backed away as
if afraid, when he told them that they themselves were instruments in
it, and that if they did not keep themselves in tune, there was sure to
be a discord somewhere.
</P>

<P>
Then there were their games and frolics. Such as were played with
balls, bats, and bags of beans, David thought he would like very much.
But the boys only scoffed when he asked them to teach him how to play.
They laughed when a dog chased a cat, and they thought it very, very
funny when Tony, the old black man, tripped on the string they drew
across his path. They liked to throw stones and shoot guns, and the
more creeping, crawling, or flying creatures that they could send to
the far country, the happier they were, apparently. Nor did they like
it at all when he asked them if they were sure all these creeping,
crawling, flying creatures wanted to leave this beautiful world and to
be made dead. They sneered and called him a sissy. David did not know
what a sissy was; but from the way they said it, he judged it must be
even worse to be a sissy than to be a thief.
</P>

<P>
And then he discovered Joe.
</P>

<P>
David had found himself in a very strange, very unlovely neighborhood
that afternoon. The street was full of papers and tin cans, the houses
were unspeakably forlorn with sagging blinds and lack of paint. Untidy
women and blear-eyed men leaned over the dilapidated fences, or lolled
on mud-tracked doorsteps. David, his shrinking eyes turning from one
side to the other, passed slowly through the street, his violin under
his arm. Nowhere could David find here the tiniest spot of beauty to
"play." He had reached quite the most forlorn little shanty on the
street when the promise in his father's letter occurred to him. With a
suddenly illumined face, he raised his violin to position and plunged
into a veritable whirl of trills and runs and tripping melodies.
</P>

<P>
"If I didn't just entirely forget that I didn't NEED to SEE anything
beautiful to play," laughed David softly to himself. "Why, it's already
right here in my violin!"
</P>

<P>
David had passed the tumble-down shanty, and was hesitating where two
streets crossed, when he felt a light touch on his arm. He turned to
confront a small girl in a patched and faded calico dress, obviously
outgrown. Her eyes were wide and frightened. In the middle of her
outstretched dirty little palm was a copper cent.
</P>

<P>
"If you please, Joe sent this&mdash;to you," she faltered.
</P>

<P>
"To me? What for?" David stopped playing and lowered his violin.
</P>

<P>
The little girl backed away perceptibly, though she still held out the
coin.
</P>

<P>
"He wanted you to stay and play some more. He said to tell you he'd 'a'
sent more money if he could. But he didn't have it. He just had this
cent."
</P>

<P>
David's eyes flew wide open.
</P>

<P>
"You mean he WANTS me to play? He likes it?" he asked joyfully.
</P>

<P>
"Yes. He said he knew 't wa'n't much&mdash;the cent. But he thought maybe
you'd play a LITTLE for it."
</P>

<P>
"Play? Of course I'll play" cried David. "Oh, no, I don't want the
money," he added, waving the again-proffered coin aside. "I don't need
money where I'm living now. Where is he&mdash;the one that wanted me to
play?" he finished eagerly.
</P>

<P>
"In there by the window. It's Joe. He's my brother." The little girl,
in spite of her evident satisfaction at the accomplishment of her
purpose, yet kept quite aloof from the boy. Nor did the fact that he
refused the money appear to bring her anything but uneasy surprise.
</P>

<P>
In the window David saw a boy apparently about his own age, a boy with
sandy hair, pale cheeks, and wide-open, curiously intent blue eyes.
</P>

<P>
"Is he coming? Did you get him? Will he play?" called the boy at the
window eagerly.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, I'm right here. I'm the one. Can't you see the violin? Shall I
play here or come in?" answered David, not one whit less eagerly.
</P>

<P>
The small girl opened her lips as if to explain something; but the boy
in the window did not wait.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, come in. WILL you come in?" he cried unbelievingly. "And will you
just let me touch it&mdash;the fiddle? Come! You WILL come? See, there isn't
anybody home, only just Betty and me."
</P>

<P>
"Of course I will!" David fairly stumbled up the broken steps in his
impatience to reach the wide-open door. "Did you like it&mdash;what I
played? And did you know what I was playing? Did you understand? Could
you see the cloud-boats up in the sky, and my Silver Lake down in the
valley? And could you hear the birds, and the winds in the trees, and
the little brooks? Could you? Oh, did you understand? I've so wanted to
find some one that could! But I wouldn't think that YOU&mdash;HERE&mdash;" With a
gesture, and an expression on his face that were unmistakable, David
came to a helpless pause.
</P>

<P>
"There, Joe, what'd I tell you," cried the little girl, in a husky
whisper, darting to her brother's side. "Oh, why did you make me get
him here? Everybody says he's crazy as a loon, and&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
But the boy reached out a quickly silencing hand. His face was
curiously alight, as if from an inward glow. His eyes, still widely
intent, were staring straight ahead.
</P>

<P>
"Stop, Betty, wait," he hushed her. "Maybe&mdash;I think I DO understand.
Boy, you mean&mdash;INSIDE of you, you see those things, and then you try to
make your fiddle tell what you are seeing. Is that it?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, yes," cried David. "Oh, you DO understand. And I never thought
you could. I never thought that anybody could that did n't have
anything to look at but him&mdash;but these things."
</P>

<P>
"'Anything but these to look at'!" echoed the boy, with a sudden
anguish in his voice. "Anything but these! I guess if I could see
ANYTHING, I wouldn't mind WHAT I see! An' you wouldn't, neither, if you
was&mdash;blind, like me."
</P>

<P>
"Blind!" David fell back. Face and voice were full of horror. "You mean
you can't see&mdash;anything, with your eyes?"
</P>

<P>
"Nothin'."
</P>

<P>
"Oh! I never saw any one blind before. There was one in a book&mdash;but
father took it away. Since then, in books down here, I've found
others&mdash;but&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, yes. Well, never mind that," cut in the blind boy, growing
restive under the pity in the other's voice. "Play. Won't you?"
</P>

<P>
"But how are you EVER going to know what a beautiful world it is?"
shuddered David. "How can you know? And how can you ever play in tune?
You're one of the instruments. Father said everybody was. And he said
everybody was playing SOMETHING all the time; and if you didn't play in
tune&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"Joe, Joe, please," begged the little girl "Won't you let him go? I'm
afraid. I told you&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"Shucks, Betty! He won't hurt ye," laughed Joe, a little irritably.
Then to David he turned again with some sharpness.
</P>

<P>
"Play, won't ye? You SAID you'd play!"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, oh, yes, I'll play," faltered David, bringing his violin hastily
to position, and testing the strings with fingers that shook a little.
</P>

<P>
"There!" breathed Joe, settling back in his chair with a contented
sigh. "Now, play it again&mdash;what you did before."
</P>

<P>
But David did not play what he did before&mdash;at first. There were no airy
cloud-boats, no far-reaching sky, no birds, or murmuring forest brooks
in his music this time. There were only the poverty-stricken room, the
dirty street, the boy alone at the window, with his sightless eyes&mdash;the
boy who never, never would know what a beautiful world he lived in.
</P>

<P>
Then suddenly to David came a new thought. This boy, Joe, had said
before that he understood. He had seemed to know that he was being told
of the sunny skies and the forest winds, the singing birds and the
babbling brooks. Perhaps again now he would understand.
</P>

<P>
What if, for those sightless eyes, one could create a world?
</P>

<P>
Possibly never before had David played as he played then. It was as if
upon those four quivering strings, he was laying the purple and gold of
a thousand sunsets, the rose and amber of a thousand sunrises, the
green of a boundless earth, the blue of a sky that reached to heaven
itself&mdash;to make Joe understand.
</P>

<P>
"Gee!" breathed Joe, when the music came to an end with a crashing
chord. "Say, wa'n't that just great? Won't you let me, please, just
touch that fiddle?" And David, looking into the blind boy's exalted
face, knew that Joe had indeed&mdash;understood.

CHAPTER X
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
THE LADY OF THE ROSES
</H3>

<P>
It was a new world, indeed, that David created for Joe after that&mdash;a
world that had to do with entrancing music where once was silence;
delightful companionship where once was loneliness; and toothsome
cookies and doughnuts where once was hunger.
</P>

<P>
The Widow Glaspell, Joe's mother, worked out by the day, scrubbing and
washing; and Joe, perforce, was left to the somewhat erratic and
decidedly unskillful ministrations of Betty. Betty was no worse, and no
better, than any other untaught, irresponsible twelve-year-old girl,
and it was not to be expected, perhaps, that she would care to spend
all the bright sunny hours shut up with her sorely afflicted and
somewhat fretful brother. True, at noon she never failed to appear and
prepare something that passed for a dinner for herself and Joe. But the
Glaspell larder was frequently almost as empty as were the hungry
stomachs that looked to it for refreshment; and it would have taken a
far more skillful cook than was the fly-away Betty to evolve anything
from it that was either palatable or satisfying.
</P>

<P>
With the coming of David into Joe's life all this was changed. First,
there were the music and the companionship. Joe's father had "played in
the band" in his youth, and (according to the Widow Glaspell) had been
a "powerful hand for music." It was from him, presumably, that Joe had
inherited his passion for melody and harmony; and it was no wonder that
David recognized so soon in the blind boy the spirit that made them
kin. At the first stroke of David's bow, indeed, the dingy walls about
them would crumble into nothingness, and together the two boys were off
in a fairy world of loveliness and joy.
</P>

<P>
Nor was listening always Joe's part. From "just touching" the
violin&mdash;his first longing plea&mdash;he came to drawing a timid bow across
the strings. In an incredibly short time, then, he was picking out bits
of melody; and by the end of a fortnight David had brought his father's
violin for Joe to practice on.
</P>

<P>
"I can't GIVE it to you&mdash;not for keeps," David had explained, a bit
tremulously, "because it was daddy's, you know; and when I see it, it
seems almost as if I was seeing him. But you may take it. Then you can
have it here to play on whenever you like."
</P>

<P>
After that, in Joe's own hands lay the power to transport himself into
another world, for with the violin for company he knew no loneliness.
</P>

<P>
Nor was the violin all that David brought to the house. There were the
doughnuts and the cookies. Very early in his visits David had
discovered, much to his surprise, that Joe and Betty were often hungry.
</P>

<P>
"But why don't you go down to the store and buy something?" he had
queried at once.
</P>

<P>
Upon being told that there was no money to buy with, David's first
impulse had been to bring several of the gold-pieces the next time he
came; but upon second thoughts David decided that he did not dare. He
was not wishing to be called a thief a second time. It would be better,
he concluded, to bring some food from the house instead.
</P>

<P>
In his mountain home everything the house afforded in the way of food
had always been freely given to the few strangers that found their way
to the cabin door. So now David had no hesitation in going to Mrs.
Holly's pantry for supplies, upon the occasion of his next visit to Joe
Glaspell's.
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Holly, coming into the kitchen, found him merging from the pantry
with both hands full of cookies and doughnuts.
</P>

<P>
"Why, David, what in the world does this mean?" she demanded.
</P>

<P>
"They're for Joe and Betty," smiled David happily.
</P>

<P>
"For Joe and&mdash;But those doughnuts and cookies don't belong to you.
They're mine!"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, I know they are. I told them you had plenty," nodded David.
</P>

<P>
"Plenty! What if I have?" remonstrated Mrs. Holly, in growing
indignation. "That doesn't mean that you can take&mdash;" Something in
David's face stopped the words half-spoken.
</P>

<P>
"You don't mean that I CAN'T take them to Joe and Betty, do you? Why,
Mrs. Holly, they're hungry! Joe and Betty are. They don't have half
enough to eat. Betty said so. And we've got more than we want. There's
food left on the table every day. Why, if YOU were hungry, wouldn't you
want somebody to bring&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
But Mrs. Holly stopped him with a despairing gesture.
</P>

<P>
"There, there, never mind. Run along. Of course you can take them.
I'm&mdash;I'm GLAD to have you," she finished, in a desperate attempt to
drive from David's face that look of shocked incredulity with which he
was still regarding her.
</P>

<P>
Never again did Mrs. Holly attempt to thwart David's generosity to the
Glaspells; but she did try to regulate it. She saw to it that
thereafter, upon his visits to the house, he took only certain things
and a certain amount, and invariably things of her own choosing.
</P>

<P>
But not always toward the Glaspell shanty did David turn his steps.
Very frequently it was in quite another direction. He had been at the
Holly farmhouse three weeks when he found his Lady of the Roses.
</P>

<P>
He had passed quite through the village that day, and had come to a
road that was new to him. It was a beautiful road, smooth, white, and
firm. Two huge granite posts topped with flaming nasturtiums marked the
point where it turned off from the main highway. Beyond these, as David
soon found, it ran between wide-spreading lawns and flowering shrubs,
leading up the gentle slope of a hill. Where it led to, David did not
know, but he proceeded unhesitatingly to try to find out. For some time
he climbed the slope in silence, his violin, mute, under his arm; but
the white road still lay in tantalizing mystery before him when a
by-path offered the greater temptation, and lured him to explore its
cool shadowy depths instead.
</P>

<P>
Had David but known it, he was at Sunny-crest, Hinsdale's one "show
place," the country home of its one really rich resident, Miss Barbara
Holbrook. Had he also but known it, Miss Holbrook was not celebrated
for her graciousness to any visitors, certainly not to those who
ventured to approach her otherwise than by a conventional ring at her
front doorbell. But David did not know all this; and he therefore very
happily followed the shady path until he came to the Wonder at the end
of it.
</P>

<P>
The Wonder, in Hinsdale parlance, was only Miss Holbrook's garden, but
in David's eyes it was fairyland come true. For one whole minute he
could only stand like a very ordinary little boy and stare. At the end
of the minute he became himself once more; and being himself, he
expressed his delight at once in the only way he knew how to do&mdash;by
raising his violin and beginning to play.
</P>

<P>
He had meant to tell of the limpid pool and of the arch of the bridge
it reflected; of the terraced lawns and marble steps, and of the
gleaming white of the sculptured nymphs and fauns; of the splashes of
glorious crimson, yellow, blush-pink, and snowy white against the
green, where the roses rioted in luxurious bloom. He had meant, also,
to tell of the Queen Rose of them all&mdash;the beauteous lady with hair
like the gold of sunrise, and a gown like the shimmer of the moon on
water&mdash;of all this he had meant to tell; but he had scarcely begun to
tell it at all when the Beauteous Lady of the Roses sprang to her feet
and became so very much like an angry young woman who is seriously
displeased that David could only lower his violin in dismay.
</P>

<P>
"Why, boy, what does this mean?" she demanded.
</P>

<P>
David sighed a little impatiently as he came forward into the sunlight.
</P>

<P>
"But I was just telling you," he remonstrated, "and you would not let
me finish."
</P>

<P>
"Telling me!"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, with my violin. COULDn't you understand?" appealed the boy
wistfully. "You looked as if you could!"
</P>

<P>
"Looked as if I could!"
</P>

<P>
"Yes. Joe understood, you see, and I was surprised when HE did. But I
was just sure you could&mdash;with all this to look at."
</P>

<P>
The lady frowned. Half-unconsciously she glanced about her as if
contemplating flight. Then she turned back to the boy.
</P>

<P>
"But how came you here? Who are you?" she cried.
</P>

<P>
"I'm David. I walked here through the little path back there. I didn't
know where it went to, but I'm so glad now I found out!"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, are you!" murmured the lady, with slightly uplifted brows.
</P>

<P>
She was about to tell him very coldly that now that he had found his
way there he might occupy himself in finding it home again, when the
boy interposed rapturously, his eyes sweeping the scene before him:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"Yes. I didn't suppose, anywhere, down here, there was a place one half
so beautiful!"
</P>

<P>
An odd feeling of uncanniness sent a swift exclamation to the lady's
lips.
</P>

<P>
"'Down here'! What do you mean by that? You speak as if you came
from&mdash;above," she almost laughed.
</P>

<P>
"I did," returned David simply. "But even up there I never found
anything quite like this,"&mdash;with a sweep of his hands,&mdash;"nor like you,
O Lady of the Roses," he finished with an admiration that was as open
as it was ardent.
</P>

<P>
This time the lady laughed outright. She even blushed a little.
</P>

<P>
"Very prettily put, Sir Flatterer" she retorted; "but when you are
older, young man, you won't make your compliments quite so broad. I am
no Lady of the Roses. I am Miss Holbrook; and&mdash;and I am not in the
habit of receiving gentlemen callers who are uninvited
and&mdash;unannounced," she concluded, a little sharply.
</P>

<P>
Pointless the shaft fell at David's feet. He had turned again to the
beauties about him, and at that moment he spied the sundial&mdash;something
he had never seen before.
</P>

<P>
"What is it?" he cried eagerly, hurrying forward. "It isn't exactly
pretty, and yet it looks as if 't were meant for&mdash;something."
</P>

<P>
"It is. It is a sundial. It marks the time by the sun."
</P>

<P>
Even as she spoke, Miss Holbrook wondered why she answered the question
at all; why she did not send this small piece of nonchalant
impertinence about his business, as he so richly deserved. The next
instant she found herself staring at the boy in amazement. With
unmistakable ease, and with the trained accent of the scholar, he was
reading aloud the Latin inscription on the dial: "'Horas non numero
nisi serenas,' 'I count&mdash;no&mdash;hours but&mdash;unclouded ones,'" he translated
then, slowly, though with confidence. "That's pretty; but what does it
mean&mdash;about 'counting'?"
</P>

<P>
Miss Holbrook rose to her feet.
</P>

<P>
"For Heaven's sake, boy, who, and what are you?" she demanded. "Can YOU
read Latin?"
</P>

<P>
"Why, of course! Can't you?" With a disdainful gesture Miss Holbrook
swept this aside.
</P>

<P>
"Boy, who are you?" she demanded again imperatively.
</P>

<P>
"I'm David. I told you."
</P>

<P>
"But David who? Where do you live?"
</P>

<P>
The boy's face clouded.
</P>

<P>
"I'm David&mdash;just David. I live at Farmer Holly's now; but I did live on
the mountain with&mdash;father, you know."
</P>

<P>
A great light of understanding broke over Miss Holbrook's face. She
dropped back into her seat.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, I remember," she murmured. "You're the little&mdash;er&mdash;boy whom he
took. I have heard the story. So THAT is who you are," she added, the
old look of aversion coming back to her eyes. She had almost said "the
little tramp boy"&mdash;but she had stopped in time.
</P>

<P>
"Yes. And now what do they mean, please,&mdash;those words,&mdash;'I count no
hours but unclouded ones'?"
</P>

<P>
Miss Holbrook stirred in her seat and frowned.
</P>

<P>
"Why, it means what it says, of course, boy. A sundial counts its hours
by the shadow the sun throws, and when there is no sun there is no
shadow; hence it's only the sunny hours that are counted by the dial,"
she explained a little fretfully.
</P>

<P>
David's face radiated delight.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, but I like that!" he exclaimed.
</P>

<P>
"You like it!"
</P>

<P>
"Yes. I should like to be one myself, you know."
</P>

<P>
"Well, really! And how, pray?" In spite of herself a faint gleam of
interest came into Miss Holbrook's eyes.
</P>

<P>
David laughed and dropped himself easily to the ground at her feet. He
was holding his violin on his knees now.
</P>

<P>
"Why, it would be such fun," he chuckled, "to just forget all about the
hours when the sun didn't shine, and remember only the nice, pleasant
ones. Now for me, there wouldn't be any hours, really, until after four
o'clock, except little specks of minutes that I'd get in between when I
DID see something interesting."
</P>

<P>
Miss Holbrook stared frankly.
</P>

<P>
"What an extraordinary boy you are, to be sure," she murmured. "And
what, may I ask, is it that you do every day until four o'clock, that
you wish to forget?"
</P>

<P>
David sighed.
</P>

<P>
"Well, there are lots of things. I hoed potatoes and corn, first, but
they're too big now, mostly; and I pulled up weeds, too, till they were
gone. I've been picking up stones, lately, and clearing up the yard.
Then, of course, there's always the woodbox to fill, and the eggs to
hunt, besides the chickens to feed,&mdash;though I don't mind THEM so much;
but I do the other things, 'specially the weeds. They were so much
prettier than the things I had to let grow, 'most always."
</P>

<P>
Miss Holbrook laughed.
</P>

<P>
"Well, they were; and really" persisted the boy, in answer to the
merriment in her eyes; "now wouldn't it be nice to be like the sundial,
and forget everything the sun didn't shine on? Would n't you like it?
Isn't there anything YOU want to forget?"
</P>

<P>
Miss Holbrook sobered instantly. The change in her face was so very
marked, indeed, that involuntarily David looked about for something
that might have cast upon it so great a shadow. For a long minute she
did not speak; then very slowly, very bitterly, she said aloud&mdash;yet as
if to herself:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"Yes. If I had my way I'd forget them every one&mdash;these hours; every
single one!"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, Lady of the Roses!" expostulated David in a voice quivering with
shocked dismay. "You don't mean&mdash;you can't mean that you don't have
ANY&mdash;sun!"
</P>

<P>
"I mean just that," bowed Miss Holbrook wearily, her eyes on the somber
shadows of the pool; "just that!"
</P>

<P>
David sat stunned, confounded. Across the marble steps and the terraces
the shadows lengthened, and David watched them as the sun dipped behind
the tree-tops. They seemed to make more vivid the chill and the gloom
of the lady's words&mdash;more real the day that had no sun. After a time
the boy picked up his violin and began to play, softly, and at first
with evident hesitation. Even when his touch became more confident,
there was still in the music a questioning appeal that seemed to find
no answer&mdash;an appeal that even the player himself could not have
explained.
</P>

<P>
For long minutes the young woman and the boy sat thus in the twilight.
Then suddenly the woman got to her feet.
</P>

<P>
"Come, come, boy, what can I be thinking of?" she cried sharply. "I
must go in and you must go home. Good-night." And she swept across the
grass to the path that led toward the house.
</P>

CHAPTER XI
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
JACK AND JILL
</H3>

<P>
David was tempted to go for a second visit to his Lady of the Roses,
but something he could not define held him back. The lady was in his
mind almost constantly, however; and very vivid to him was the picture
of the garden, though always it was as he had seen it last with the
hush and shadow of twilight, and with the lady's face gloomily turned
toward the sunless pool. David could not forget that for her there were
no hours to count; she had said it herself. He could not understand how
this could be so; and the thought filled him with vague unrest and pain.
</P>

<P>
Perhaps it was this restlessness that drove David to explore even more
persistently the village itself, sending him into new streets in search
of something strange and interesting. One day the sound of shouts and
laughter drew him to an open lot back of the church where some boys
were at play.
</P>

<P>
David still knew very little of boys. In his mountain home he had never
had them for playmates, and he had not seen much of them when he went
with his father to the mountain village for supplies. There had been,
it is true, the boy who frequently brought milk and eggs to the cabin;
but he had been very quiet and shy, appearing always afraid and anxious
to get away, as if he had been told not to stay. More recently, since
David had been at the Holly farmhouse, his experience with boys had
been even less satisfying. The boys&mdash;with the exception of blind
Joe&mdash;had very clearly let it be understood that they had little use for
a youth who could find nothing better to do than to tramp through the
woods and the streets with a fiddle under his arm.
</P>

<P>
To-day, however, there came a change. Perhaps they were more used to
him; or perhaps they had decided suddenly that it might be good fun to
satisfy their curiosity, anyway, regardless of consequences. Whatever
it was, the lads hailed his appearance with wild shouts of glee.
</P>

<P>
"Golly, boys, look! Here's the fiddlin' kid," yelled one; and the
others joined in the "Hurrah!" he gave.
</P>

<P>
David smiled delightedly; once more he had found some one who wanted
him&mdash;and it was so nice to be wanted! Truth to tell, David had felt not
a little hurt at the persistent avoidance of all those boys and girls
of his own age.
</P>

<P>
"How&mdash;how do you do?" he said diffidently, but still with that beaming
smile.
</P>

<P>
Again the boys shouted gleefully as they hurried forward. Several had
short sticks in their hands. One had an old tomato can with a string
tied to it. The tallest boy had something that he was trying to hold
beneath his coat.
</P>

<P>
"'H&mdash;how do you do?'" they mimicked. "How do you do, fiddlin' kid?"
</P>

<P>
"I'm David; my name is David." The reminder was graciously given, with
a smile.
</P>

<P>
"David! David! His name is David," chanted the boys, as if they were a
comic-opera chorus.
</P>

<P>
David laughed outright.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, sing it again, sing it again!" he crowed. "That sounded fine!"
</P>

<P>
The boys stared, then sniffed disdainfully, and cast derisive glances
into each other's eyes&mdash;it appeared that this little sissy tramp boy
did not even know enough to discover when he was being laughed at!
</P>

<P>
"David! David! His name is David," they jeered into his face again.
"Come on, tune her up! We want ter dance."
</P>

<P>
"Play? Of course I'll play," cried David joyously, raising his violin
and testing a string for its tone.
</P>

<P>
"Here, hold on," yelled the tallest boy. "The Queen o' the Ballet ain't
ready". And he cautiously pulled from beneath his coat a struggling
kitten with a perforated bag tied over its head.
</P>

<P>
"Sure! We want her in the middle," grinned the boy with the tin can.
"Hold on till I get her train tied to her," he finished, trying to
capture the swishing, fluffy tail of the frightened little cat.
</P>

<P>
David had begun to play, but he stopped his music with a discordant
stroke of the bow.
</P>

<P>
"What are you doing? What is the matter with that cat?" he demanded.
</P>

<P>
"'Matter'!" called a derisive voice. "Sure, nothin' 's the matter with
her. She's the Queen o' the Ballet&mdash;she is!"
</P>

<P>
"What do you mean?" cried David. At that moment the string bit hard
into the captured tail, and the kitten cried out with the pain. "Look
out! You're hurting her," cautioned David sharply.
</P>

<P>
Only a laugh and a jeering word answered. Then the kitten, with the bag
on its head and the tin can tied to its tail, was let warily to the
ground, the tall boy still holding its back with both hands.
</P>

<P>
"Ready, now! Come on, play," he ordered; "then we'll set her dancing."
</P>

<P>
David's eyes flashed.
</P>

<P>
"I will not play&mdash;for that."
</P>

<P>
The boys stopped laughing suddenly.
</P>

<P>
"Eh? What?" They could scarcely have been more surprised if the kitten
itself had said the words.
</P>

<P>
"I say I won't play&mdash;I can't play&mdash;unless you let that cat go."
</P>

<P>
"Hoity-toity! Won't ye hear that now?" laughed a mocking voice. "And
what if we say we won't let her go, eh?"
</P>

<P>
"Then I'll make you," vowed David, aflame with a newborn something that
seemed to have sprung full-grown into being.
</P>

<P>
"Yow!" hooted the tallest boy, removing both hands from the captive
kitten.
</P>

<P>
The kitten, released, began to back frantically. The can, dangling at
its heels, rattled and banged and thumped, until the frightened little
creature, crazed with terror, became nothing but a whirling mass of
misery. The boys, formed now into a crowing circle of delight, kept the
kitten within bounds, and flouted David mercilessly.
</P>

<P>
"Ah, ha!&mdash;stop us, will ye? Why don't ye stop us?" they gibed.
</P>

<P>
For a moment David stood without movement, his eyes staring. The next
instant he turned and ran. The jeers became a chorus of triumphant
shouts then&mdash;but not for long. David had only hurried to the woodpile
to lay down his violin. He came back then, on the run&mdash;and before the
tallest boy could catch his breath he was felled by a stinging blow on
the jaw.
</P>

<P>
Over by the church a small girl, red-haired and red-eyed, clambered
hastily over the fence behind which for long minutes she had been
crying and wringing her hands.
</P>

<P>
"He'll be killed, he'll be killed," she moaned.  "And it's my fault,
'cause it's my kitty&mdash;it's my kitty," she sobbed, straining her eyes to
catch a glimpse of the kitten's protector in the squirming mass of legs
and arms.
</P>

<P>
The kitten, unheeded now by the boys, was pursuing its backward whirl
to destruction some distance away, and very soon the little girl
discovered her. With a bound and a choking cry she reached the kitten,
removed the bag and unbound the cruel string. Then, sitting on the
ground, a safe distance away, she soothed the palpitating little bunch
of gray fur, and watched with fearful eyes the fight.
</P>

<P>
And what a fight it was! There was no question, of course, as to its
final outcome, with six against one; but meanwhile the one was giving
the six the surprise of their lives in the shape of well-dealt blows
and skillful twists and turns that caused their own strength and weight
to react upon themselves in a most astonishing fashion. The one
unmistakably was getting the worst of it, however, when the little
girl, after a hurried dash to the street, brought back with her to the
rescue a tall, smooth-shaven young man whom she had hailed from afar as
"Jack."
</P>

<P>
Jack put a stop to things at once. With vigorous jerks and pulls he
unsnarled the writhing mass, boy by boy, each one of whom, upon
catching sight of his face, slunk hurriedly away, as if glad to escape
so lightly. There was left finally upon the ground only David alone.
But when David did at last appear, the little girl burst into tears
anew.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, Jack, he's killed&mdash;I know he's killed," she wailed. "And he was so
nice and&mdash;and pretty. And now&mdash;look at him! Ain't he a sight?"
</P>

<P>
David was not killed, but he was&mdash;a sight. His blouse was torn, his tie
was gone, and his face and hands were covered with dirt and blood.
Above one eye was an ugly-looking lump, and below the other was a red
bruise. Somewhat dazedly he responded to the man's helpful hand, pulled
himself upright, and looked about him. He did not see the little girl
behind him.
</P>

<P>
"Where's the cat?" he asked anxiously.
</P>

<P>
The unexpected happened then. With a sobbing cry the little girl flung
herself upon him, cat and all.
</P>

<P>
"Here, right here," she choked. "And it was you who saved her&mdash;my
Juliette! And I'll love you, love you, love you always for it!"
</P>

<P>
"There, there, Jill," interposed the man a little hurriedly. "Suppose
we first show our gratitude by seeing if we can't do something to make
our young warrior here more comfortable." And he began to brush off
with his handkerchief some of the accumulated dirt.
</P>

<P>
"Why can't we take him home, Jack, and clean him up 'fore other folks
see him?" suggested the girl.
</P>

<P>
The boy turned quickly.
</P>

<P>
"Did you call him 'Jack'?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes."
</P>

<P>
"And he called you, Jill'?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes."
</P>

<P>
"The real 'Jack and Jill' that 'went up the hill'?" The man and the
girl laughed; but the girl shook her head as she answered,&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"Not really&mdash;though we do go up a hill, all right, every day. But those
aren't even our own names. We just call each other that for fun. Don't
YOU ever call things&mdash;for fun?"
</P>

<P>
David's face lighted up in spite of the dirt, the lump, and the bruise.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, do you do that?" he breathed.  "Say, I just know I'd like to play
to you! You'd understand!"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, yes, and he plays, too," explained the little girl, turning to the
man rapturously. "On a fiddle, you know, like you."
</P>

<P>
She had not finished her sentence before David was away, hurrying a
little unsteadily across the lot for his violin. When he came back the
man was looking at him with an anxious frown.
</P>

<P>
"Suppose you come home with us, boy," he said. "It isn't far&mdash;through
the hill pasture, 'cross lots,&mdash;and we'll look you over a bit. That
lump over your eye needs attention."
</P>

<P>
"Thank you," beamed David. "I'd like to go, and&mdash;I'm glad you want me!"
He spoke to the man, but he looked at the little red-headed girl, who
still held the gray kitten in her arms.

CHAPTER XII
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
ANSWERS THAT DID NOT ANSWER
</H3>

<P>
"Jack and Jill," it appeared, were a brother and sister who lived in a
tiny house on a hill directly across the creek from Sunnycrest. Beyond
this David learned little until after bumps and bruises and dirt had
been carefully attended to. He had then, too, some questions to answer
concerning himself.
</P>

<P>
"And now, if you please," began the man smilingly, as he surveyed the
boy with an eye that could see no further service to be rendered, "do
you mind telling me who you are, and how you came to be the center of
attraction for the blows and cuffs of six boys?"
</P>

<P>
"I'm David, and I wanted the cat," returned the boy simply.
</P>

<P>
"Well, that's direct and to the point, to say the least," laughed the
man. "Evidently, however, you're in the habit of being that. But,
David, there were six of them,&mdash;those boys,&mdash;and some of them were
larger than you."
</P>

<P>
"Yes, sir."
</P>

<P>
"And they were so bad and cruel," chimed in the little girl.
</P>

<P>
The man hesitated, then questioned slowly.
</P>

<P>
"And may I ask you where you&mdash;er&mdash;learned to&mdash;fight like that?"
</P>

<P>
"I used to box with father. He said I must first be well and strong. He
taught me jiujitsu, too, a little; but I couldn't make it work very
well&mdash;with so many."
</P>

<P>
"I should say not," adjudged the man grimly. "But you gave them a
surprise or two, I'll warrant," he added, his eyes on the cause of the
trouble, now curled in a little gray bunch of content on the window
sill. "But I don't know yet who you are. Who is your father? Where does
he live?"
</P>

<P>
David shook his head. As was always the case when his father was
mentioned, his face grew wistful and his eyes dreamy.
</P>

<P>
"He doesn't live here anywhere," murmured the boy. "In the far country
he is waiting for me to come to him and tell him of the beautiful world
I have found, you know."
</P>

<P>
"Eh? What?" stammered the man, not knowing whether to believe his eyes,
or his ears. This boy who fought like a demon and talked like a saint,
and who, though battered and bruised, prattled of the "beautiful world"
he had found, was most disconcerting.
</P>

<P>
"Why, Jack, don't you know?" whispered the little girl agitatedly.
"He's the boy at Mr. Holly's that they took." Then, still more softly:
"He's the little tramp boy. His father died in the barn."
</P>

<P>
"Oh," said the man, his face clearing, and his eyes showing a quick
sympathy. "You're the boy at the Holly farmhouse, are you?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, sir."
</P>

<P>
"And he plays the fiddle everywhere," volunteered the little girl, with
ardent admiration. "If you hadn't been shut up sick just now, you'd
have heard him yourself. He plays everywhere&mdash;everywhere he goes."
</P>

<P>
"Is that so?" murmured Jack politely, shuddering a little at what he
fancied would come from a violin played by a boy like the one before
him. (Jack could play the violin himself a little&mdash;enough to know it
some, and love it more.) "Hm-m; well, and what else do you do?"
</P>

<P>
"Nothing, except to go for walks and read."
</P>

<P>
"Nothing!&mdash;a big boy like you&mdash;and on Simeon Holly's farm?" Voice and
manner showed that Jack was not unacquainted with Simeon Holly and his
methods and opinions.
</P>

<P>
David laughed gleefully.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, of course, REALLY I do lots of things, only I don't count those
any more. 'Horas non numero nisi serenas,' you knew," he quoted
pleasantly, smiling into the man's astonished eyes.
</P>

<P>
"Jack, what was that&mdash;what he said?" whispered the little girl. "It
sounded foreign. IS he foreign?"
</P>

<P>
"You've got me, Jill," retorted the man, with a laughing grimace.
"Heaven only knows what he is&mdash;I don't. What he SAID was Latin; I do
happen to know that. Still"&mdash;he turned to the boy ironically&mdash;"of
course you know the translation of that," he said.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, yes. 'I count no hours but unclouded ones'&mdash;and I liked that. 'T
was on a sundial, you know; and I'M going to be a sundial, and not
count, the hours I don't like&mdash;while I'm pulling up weeds, and hoeing
potatoes, and picking up stones, and all that. Don't you see?"
</P>

<P>
For a moment the man stared dumbly. Then he threw back his head and
laughed.
</P>

<P>
"Well, by George!" he muttered. "By George!" And he laughed again.
Then: "And did your father teach you that, too?" he asked.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, no,&mdash;well, he taught me Latin, and so of course I could read it
when I found it. But those 'special words I got off the sundial where
my Lady of the Roses lives."
</P>

<P>
"Your&mdash;Lady of the Roses! And who is she?"
</P>

<P>
"Why, don't you know? You live right in sight of her house," cried
David, pointing to the towers of Sunnycrest that showed above the
trees. "It's over there she lives. I know those towers now, and I look
for them wherever I go. I love them. It makes me see all over again the
roses&mdash;and her."
</P>

<P>
"You mean&mdash;Miss Holbrook?"
</P>

<P>
The voice was so different from the genial tones that he had heard
before that David looked up in surprise.
</P>

<P>
"Yes; she said that was her name," he answered, wondering at the
indefinable change that had come to the man's face.
</P>

<P>
There was a moment's pause, then the man rose to his feet.
</P>

<P>
"How's your head? Does it ache?" he asked briskly.
</P>

<P>
"Not much&mdash;some. I&mdash;I think I'll be going," replied David, a little
awkwardly, reaching for his violin, and unconsciously showing by his
manner the sudden chill in the atmosphere.
</P>

<P>
The little girl spoke then. She overwhelmed him again with thanks, and
pointed to the contented kitten on the window sill. True, she did not
tell him this time that she would love, love, love him always; but she
beamed upon him gratefully and she urged him to come soon again, and
often.
</P>

<P>
David bowed himself off, with many a backward wave of the hand, and
many a promise to come again. Not until he had quite reached the bottom
of the hill did he remember that the man, "Jack," had said almost
nothing at the last. As David recollected him, indeed, he had last been
seen standing beside one of the veranda posts, with gloomy eyes fixed
on the towers of Sunnycrest that showed red-gold above the tree-tops in
the last rays of the setting sun.
</P>

<P>
It was a bad half-hour that David spent at the Holly farmhouse in
explanation of his torn blouse and bruised face. Farmer Holly did not
approve of fights, and he said so, very sternly indeed. Even Mrs.
Holly, who was usually so kind to him, let David understand that he was
in deep disgrace, though  she was very tender to his wounds.
</P>

<P>
David did venture to ask her, however, before he went upstairs to bed:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"Mrs. Holly, who are those people&mdash;Jack and Jill&mdash;that were so good to
me this afternoon?"
</P>

<P>
"They are John Gurnsey and his sister, Julia; but the whole town knows
them by the names they long ago gave themselves, 'Jack' and 'Jill.'"
</P>

<P>
"And do they live all alone in the little house?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, except for the Widow Glaspell, who comes in several times a week,
I believe, to cook and wash and sweep. They aren't very happy, I'm
afraid, David, and I'm glad you could rescue the little girl's kitten
for her&mdash;but you mustn't fight. No good can come of fighting!"
</P>

<P>
"I got the cat&mdash;by fighting."
</P>

<P>
"Yes, yes, I know; but&mdash;" She did not finish her sentence, and David
was only waiting for a pause to ask another question.
</P>

<P>
"Why aren't they happy, Mrs. Holly?"
</P>

<P>
"Tut, tut, David, it's a long story, and you wouldn't understand it if
I told it. It's only that they're all alone in the world, and Jack
Gurnsey isn't well. He must be thirty years old now. He had bright
hopes not so long ago studying law, or something of the sort, in the
city. Then his father died, and his mother, and he lost his health.
Something ails his lungs, and the doctors sent him here to be out of
doors. He even sleeps out of doors, they say. Anyway, he's here, and
he's making a home for his sister; but, of course, with his hopes and
ambitions&mdash;But there, David, you don't understand, of course!"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, yes, I do," breathed David, his eyes pensively turned toward a
shadowy corner. "He found his work out in the world, and then he had to
stop and couldn't do it. Poor Mr. Jack!"
</P>

CHAPTER XIII
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
A SURPRISE FOR MR. JACK
</H3>

<P>
Life at the Holly farmhouse was not what it had been. The coming of
David had introduced new elements that promised complications. Not
because he was another mouth to feed&mdash;Simeon Holly was not worrying
about that part any longer. Crops showed good promise, and all ready in
the bank even now was the necessary money to cover the dreaded note,
due the last of August. The complicating elements in regard to David
were of quite another nature.
</P>

<P>
To Simeon Holly the boy was a riddle to be sternly solved. To Ellen
Holly he was an everpresent reminder of the little boy of long ago, and
as such was to be loved and trained into a semblance of what that boy
might have become. To Perry Larson, David was the "derndest
checkerboard of sense an' nonsense goin'"&mdash;a game over which to chuckle.
</P>

<P>
At the Holly farmhouse they could not understand a boy who would leave
a supper for a sunset, or who preferred a book to a toy pistol&mdash;as
Perry Larson found out was the case on the Fourth of July; who picked
flowers, like a girl, for the table, yet who unhesitatingly struck the
first blow in a fight with six antagonists: who would not go fishing
because the fishes would not like it, nor hunting for any sort of wild
thing that had life; who hung entranced for an hour over the "millions
of lovely striped bugs" in a field of early potatoes, and who promptly
and stubbornly refused to sprinkle those same "lovely bugs" with Paris
green when discovered at his worship. All this was most perplexing, to
say the least.
</P>

<P>
Yet David worked, and worked well, and in most cases he obeyed orders
willingly. He learned much, too, that was interesting and profitable;
nor was he the only one that made strange discoveries during those July
days. The Hollys themselves learned much. They learned that the rose of
sunset and the gold of sunrise were worth looking at; and that the
massing of the thunderheads in the west meant more than just a shower.
They learned, too, that the green of the hilltop and of the
far-reaching meadow was more than grass, and that the purple haze along
the horizon was more than the mountains that lay between them and the
next State. They were beginning to see the world with David's eyes.
</P>

<P>
There were, too, the long twilights and evenings when David, on the
wings of his violin, would speed away to his mountain home, leaving
behind him a man and a woman who seemed to themselves to be listening
to the voice of a curly-headed, rosy-cheeked lad who once played at
their knees and nestled in their arms when the day was done. And here,
too, the Hollys were learning; though the thing thus learned was hidden
deep in their hearts.
</P>

<P>
It was not long after David's first visit that the boy went again to
"The House that Jack Built," as the Gurnseys called their tiny home.
(Though in reality it had been Jack's father who had built the house.
Jack and Jill, however, did not always deal with realities.) It was not
a pleasant afternoon. There was a light mist in the air, and David was
without his violin.
</P>

<P>
"I came to&mdash;to inquire for the cat&mdash;Juliette," he began, a little
bashfully. "I thought I'd rather do that than read to-day," he
explained to Jill in the doorway.
</P>

<P>
"Good! I'm so glad! I hoped you'd come," the little girl welcomed him.
"Come in and&mdash;and see Juliette," she added hastily, remembering at the
last moment that her brother had not looked with entire favor on her
avowed admiration for this strange little boy.
</P>

<P>
Juliette, roused from her nap, was at first inclined to resent her
visitor's presence. In five minutes, however, she was purring in his
lap.
</P>

<P>
The conquest of the kitten once accomplished, David looked about him a
little restlessly. He began to wonder why he had come. He wished he had
gone to see Joe Glaspell instead. He wished that Jill would not sit and
stare at him like that. He wished that she would say
something&mdash;anything. But Jill, apparently struck dumb with
embarrassment, was nervously twisting the corner of her apron into a
little knot. David tried to recollect what he had talked about a few
days before, and he wondered why he had so enjoyed himself then. He
wished that something would happen&mdash;anything!&mdash;and then from an inner
room came the sound of a violin.
</P>

<P>
David raised his head.
</P>

<P>
"It's Jack," stammered the little girl&mdash;who also had been wishing
something would happen. "He plays, same as you do, on the violin."
</P>

<P>
"Does he?" beamed David. "But&mdash;" He paused, listening, a quick frown on
his face.
</P>

<P>
Over and over the violin was playing a single phrase&mdash;and the
variations in the phrase showed the indecision of the fingers and of
the mind that controlled them. Again and again with irritating
sameness, yet with a still more irritating difference, came the
succession of notes. And then David sprang to his feet, placing
Juliette somewhat unceremoniously on the floor, much to that petted
young autocrat's disgust.
</P>

<P>
"Here, where is he? Let me show him," cried the boy, and at the note of
command in his voice, Jill involuntarily rose and opened the door to
Jack's den.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, please, Mr. Jack," burst out David, hurrying into the room. "Don't
you see? You don't go at that thing right. If you'll just let me show
you a minute, we'll have it fixed in no time!"
</P>

<P>
The man with the violin stared, and lowered his bow. A slow red came to
his face. The phrase was peculiarly a difficult one, and beyond him, as
he knew; but that did not make the present intrusion into his privacy
any the more welcome.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, will we, indeed!" he retorted, a little sharply.  "Don't trouble
yourself, I beg of you, boy."
</P>

<P>
"But it isn't a mite of trouble, truly," urged David, with an ardor
that ignored the sarcasm in the other's words. "I WANT to do it."
</P>

<P>
Despite his annoyance, the man gave a short laugh.
</P>

<P>
"Well, David, I believe you. And I'll warrant you'd tackle this Brahms
concerto as nonchalantly as you did those six hoodlums with the cat the
other day&mdash;and expect to win out, too!"
</P>

<P>
"But, truly, this is easy, when you know how," laughed the boy. "See!"
</P>

<P>
To his surprise, the man found himself relinquishing the violin and bow
into the slim, eager hands that reached for them. The next moment he
fell back in amazement. Clear, distinct, yet connected like a string of
rounded pearls fell the troublesome notes from David's bow. "You see,"
smiled the boy again, and played the phrase a second time, more slowly,
and with deliberate emphasis at the difficult part. Then, as if in
answer to some irresistible summons within him, he dashed into the next
phrase and, with marvelous technique, played quite through the rippling
cadenza that completed the movement.
</P>

<P>
"Well, by George!" breathed the man dazedly, as he took the offered
violin. The next moment he had demanded vehemently: "For Heaven's sake,
who ARE you, boy?"
</P>

<P>
David's face wrinkled in grieved surprise.
</P>

<P>
"Why, I'm David. Don't you remember? I was here just the other day!"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, yes; but who taught you to play like that?"
</P>

<P>
"Father."
</P>

<P>
"'Father'!" The man echoed the word with a gesture of comic despair.
"First Latin, then jiujitsu, and now the violin! Boy, who was your
father?"
</P>

<P>
David lifted his head and frowned a little. He had been questioned so
often, and so unsympathetically, about his father that he was beginning
to resent it.
</P>

<P>
"He was daddy&mdash;just daddy; and I loved him dearly."
</P>

<P>
"But what was his name?"
</P>

<P>
"I don't know. We didn't seem to have a name like&mdash;like yours down
here. Anyway, if we did, I didn't know what it was."
</P>

<P>
"But, David,"&mdash;the man was speaking very gently now. He had motioned
the boy to a low seat by his side. The little girl was standing near,
her eyes alight with wondering interest. "He must have had a name, you
know, just the same. Didn't you ever hear any one call him anything?
Think, now."
</P>

<P>
"No." David said the single word, and turned his eyes away. It had
occurred to him, since he had come to live in the valley, that perhaps
his father did not want to have his name known. He remembered that once
the milk-and-eggs boy had asked what to call him; and his father had
laughed and answered: "I don't see but you'll have to call me 'The Old
Man of the Mountain,' as they do down in the village." That was the
only time David could recollect hearing his father say anything about
his name. At the time David had not thought much about it. But since
then, down here where they appeared to think a name was so important,
he had wondered if possibly his father had not preferred to keep his to
himself. If such were the case, he was glad now that he did not know
this name, so that he might not have to tell all these inquisitive
people who asked so many questions about it. He was glad, too, that
those men had not been able to read his father's name at the end of his
other note that first morning&mdash;if his father really did not wish his
name to be known.
</P>

<P>
"But, David, think. Where you lived, wasn't there ever anybody who
called him by name?"
</P>

<P>
David shook his head.
</P>

<P>
"I told you. We were all alone, father and I, in the little house far
up on the mountain."
</P>

<P>
"And&mdash;your mother?" Again David shook his head.
</P>

<P>
"She is an angel-mother, and angel-mothers don't live in houses, you
know."
</P>

<P>
There was a moment's pause; then gently the man asked:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"And you always lived there?"
</P>

<P>
"Six years, father said."
</P>

<P>
"And before that?"
</P>

<P>
"I don't remember." There was a touch of injured reserve in the boy's
voice which the man was quick to perceive. He took the hint at once.
</P>

<P>
"He must have been a wonderful man&mdash;your father!" he exclaimed.
</P>

<P>
The boy turned, his eyes luminous with feeling.
</P>

<P>
"He was&mdash;he was perfect! But they&mdash;down here&mdash;don't seem to know&mdash;or
care," he choked.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, but that's because they don't understand," soothed the man. "Now,
tell me&mdash;you must have practiced a lot to play like that."
</P>

<P>
"I did&mdash;but I liked it."
</P>

<P>
"And what else did you do? and how did you happen to come&mdash;down here?"
</P>

<P>
Once again David told his story, more fully, perhaps, this time than
ever before, because of the sympathetic ears that were listening.
</P>

<P>
"But now" he finished wistfully, "it's all, so different, and I'm down
here alone. Daddy went, you know, to the far country; and he can't come
back from there."
</P>

<P>
"Who told you&mdash;that?"
</P>

<P>
"Daddy himself. He wrote it to me."
</P>

<P>
"Wrote it to you!" cried the man, sitting suddenly erect.
</P>

<P>
"Yes. It was in his pocket, you see. They&mdash;found it." David's voice was
very low, and not quite steady.
</P>

<P>
"David, may I see&mdash;that letter?"
</P>

<P>
The boy hesitated; then slowly he drew it from his pocket.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, Mr. Jack. I'll let YOU see it."
</P>

<P>
Reverently, tenderly, but very eagerly the man took the note and read
it through, hoping somewhere to find a name that would help solve the
mystery. With a sigh he handed it back. His eyes were wet.
</P>

<P>
"Thank you, David. That is a beautiful letter," he said softly. "And I
believe you'll do it some day, too. You'll go to him with your violin
at your chin and the bow drawn across the strings to tell him of the
beautiful world you have found."
</P>

<P>
"Yes, sir," said David simply. Then, with a suddenly radiant smile:
"And NOW I can't help finding it a beautiful world, you know, 'cause I
don't count the hours I don't like."
</P>

<P>
"You don't what?&mdash;oh, I remember," returned Mr. Jack, a quick change
coming to his face.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, the sundial, you know, where my Lady of the Roses lives."
</P>

<P>
"Jack, what is a sundial?" broke in Jill eagerly.
</P>

<P>
Jack turned, as if in relief.
</P>

<P>
"Hullo, girlie, you there?&mdash;and so still all this time? Ask David.
He'll tell you what a sundial is. Suppose, anyhow, that you two go out
on the piazza now. I've got&mdash;er-some work to do. And the sun itself is
out; see?&mdash;through the trees there. It came out just to say
'good-night,' I'm sure. Run along, quick!" And he playfully drove them
from the room.
</P>

<P>
Alone, he turned and sat down at his desk. His work was before him, but
he did not do it. His eyes were out of the window on the golden tops of
the towers of Sunnycrest. Motionless, he watched them until they turned
gray-white in the twilight. Then he picked up his pencil and began to
write feverishly. He went to the window, however, as David stepped off
the veranda, and called merrily:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"Remember, boy, that when there's another note that baffles me, I'm
going to send for you."
</P>

<P>
"He's coming anyhow. I asked him," announced Jill.
</P>

<P>
 And David laughed back a happy "Of course I am!"<BR>

CHAPTER XIV
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
THE TOWER WINDOW
</H3>

<P>
It is not to be expected that when one's thoughts lead so persistently
to a certain place, one's feet will not follow, if they can; and
David's could&mdash;so he went to seek his Lady of the Roses.
</P>

<P>
At four o'clock one afternoon, with his violin under his arm, he
traveled the firm white road until he came to the shadowed path that
led to the garden. He had decided that he would go exactly as he went
before. He expected, in consequence, to find his Lady exactly as he had
found her before, sitting reading under the roses. Great was his
surprise and disappointment, therefore, to find the garden with no one
in it.
</P>

<P>
He had told himself that it was the sundial, the roses, the shimmering
pool, the garden itself that he wanted to see; but he knew now that it
was the lady&mdash;his Lady of the Roses. He did not even care to play,
though all around him was the beauty that had at first so charmed his
eye. Very slowly he walked across the sunlit, empty space, and entered
the path that led to the house. In his mind was no definite plan; yet
he walked on and on, until he came to the wide lawns surrounding the
house itself. He stopped then, entranced.
</P>

<P>
Stone upon stone the majestic pile raised itself until it was etched,
clean-cut, against the deep blue of the sky. The towers&mdash;his
towers&mdash;brought to David's lips a cry of delight. They were even more
enchanting here than when seen from afar over the tree-tops, and David
gazed up at them in awed wonder. From somewhere came the sound of
music&mdash;a curious sort of music that David had never heard before. He
listened intently, trying to place it; then slowly he crossed the lawn,
ascended the imposing stone steps, and softly opened one of the narrow
screen doors before the wide-open French window.
</P>

<P>
Once within the room David drew a long breath of ecstasy. Beneath his
feet he felt the velvet softness of the green moss of the woods. Above
his head he saw a sky-like canopy of blue carrying fleecy clouds on
which floated little pink-and-white children with wings, just as David
himself had so often wished that he could float. On all sides silken
hangings, like the green of swaying vines, half-hid other hangings of
feathery, snowflake lace. Everywhere mirrored walls caught the light
and reflected the potted ferns and palms so that David looked down
endless vistas of loveliness that seemed for all the world like the
long sunflecked aisles beneath the tall pines of his mountain home.
</P>

<P>
The music that David had heard at first had long since stopped; but
David had not noticed that. He stood now in the center of the room,
awed, and trembling, but enraptured. Then from somewhere came a
voice&mdash;a voice so cold that it sounded as if it had swept across a
field of ice.
</P>

<P>
"Well, boy, when you have quite finished your inspection, perhaps you
will tell me to what I am indebted for THIS visit," it said.
</P>

<P>
David turned abruptly.
</P>

<P>
"O Lady of the Roses, why didn't you tell me it was like this&mdash;in
here?" he breathed.
</P>

<P>
"Well, really," murmured the lady in the doorway, stiffly, "it had not
occurred to me that that was hardly&mdash;necessary."
</P>

<P>
"But it was!&mdash;don't you see? This is new, all new. I never saw anything
like it before; and I do so love new things. It gives me something new
to play; don't you understand?"
</P>

<P>
"New&mdash;to play?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes&mdash;on my violin," explained David, a little breathlessly, softly
testing his violin. "There's always something new in this, you know,"
he hurried on, as he tightened one of the strings, "when there's
anything new outside. Now, listen! You see I don't know myself just how
it's going to sound, and I'm always so anxious to find out." And with a
joyously rapt face he began to play.
</P>

<P>
"But, see here, boy,&mdash;you mustn't! You&mdash;" The words died on her lips;
and, to her unbounded amazement, Miss Barbara Holbrook, who had
intended peremptorily to send this persistent little tramp boy about
his business, found herself listening to a melody so compelling in its
sonorous beauty that she was left almost speechless at its close. It
was the boy who spoke.
</P>

<P>
"There, I told you my violin would know what to say!"
</P>

<P>
"'What to say'!&mdash;well, that's more than I do" laughed Miss Holbrook, a
little hysterically. "Boy, come here and tell me who you are." And she
led the way to a low divan that stood near a harp at the far end of the
room.
</P>

<P>
It was the same story, told as David had told it to Jack and Jill a few
days before, only this time David's eyes were roving admiringly all
about the room, resting oftenest on the harp so near him.
</P>

<P>
"Did that make the music that I heard?" he asked eagerly, as soon as
Miss Holbrook's questions gave him opportunity. "It's got strings."
</P>

<P>
"Yes. I was playing when you came in. I saw you enter the window.
Really, David, are you in the habit of walking into people's houses
like this? It is most disconcerting&mdash;to their owners."
</P>

<P>
"Yes&mdash;no&mdash;well, sometimes." David's eyes were still on the harp. "Lady
of the Roses, won't you please play again&mdash;on that?"
</P>

<P>
"David, you are incorrigible! Why did you come into my house like this?"
</P>

<P>
"The music said 'come'; and the towers, too. You see, I KNOW the
towers."
</P>

<P>
"You KNOW them!"
</P>

<P>
"Yes. I can see them from so many places, and I always watch for them.
They show best of anywhere, though, from Jack and Jill's. And now won't
you play?"
</P>

<P>
Miss Holbrook had almost risen to her feet when she turned abruptly.
</P>

<P>
"From&mdash;where?" she asked.
</P>

<P>
"From Jack and Jill's&mdash;the House that Jack Built, you know."
</P>

<P>
"You mean&mdash;Mr. John Gurnsey's house?" A deeper color had come into Miss
Holbrook's cheeks.
</P>

<P>
"Yes. Over there at the top of the little hill across the brook, you
know. You can't see THEIR house from here, but from over there we can
see the towers finely, and the little window&mdash;Oh, Lady of the Roses,"
he broke off excitedly, at the new thought that had come to him, "if
we, now, were in that little window, we COULD see their house. Let's go
up. Can't we?"
</P>

<P>
Explicit as this was, Miss Holbrook evidently did not hear, or at least
did not understand, this request. She settled back on the divan,
indeed, almost determinedly. Her cheeks were very red now.
</P>

<P>
"And do you know&mdash;this Mr. Jack?" she asked lightly.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, and Jill, too. Don't you? I like them, too. DO you know them?"
</P>

<P>
Again Miss Holbrook ignored the question put to her. "And did you walk
into their house, unannounced and uninvited, like this?" she queried.
</P>

<P>
"No. He asked me. You see he wanted to get off some of the dirt and
blood before other folks saw me."
</P>

<P>
 "The dirt and&mdash;and&mdash;why, David, what do you mean? What was<BR>
it&mdash;an accident?"
</P>

<P>
David frowned and reflected a moment.
</P>

<P>
"No. I did it on purpose. I HAD to, you see," he finally elucidated.
"But there were six of them, and I got the worst of it."
</P>

<P>
"David!" Miss Holbrook's voice was horrified. "You don't mean&mdash;a fight!"
</P>

<P>
"Yes'm. I wanted the cat&mdash;and I got it, but I wouldn't have if Mr. Jack
hadn't come to help me."
</P>

<P>
"Oh! So Mr. Jack&mdash;fought, too?"
</P>

<P>
"Well, he pulled the others off, and of course that helped me,"
explained David truthfully. "And then he took me home&mdash;he and Jill."
</P>

<P>
"Jill! Was she in it?"
</P>

<P>
"No, only her cat. They had tied a bag over its head and a tin can to
its tail, and of course I couldn't let them do that. They were hurting
her. And now, Lady of the Roses, won't you please play?"
</P>

<P>
For a moment Miss Holbrook did not speak. She was gazing at David with
an odd look in her eyes. At last she drew a long sigh.
</P>

<P>
"David, you are the&mdash;the LIMIT!" she breathed, as she rose and seated
herself at the harp.
</P>

<P>
David was manifestly delighted with her playing, and begged for more
when she had finished; but Miss Holbrook shook her head. She seemed to
have grown suddenly restless, and she moved about the room calling
David's attention to something new each moment. Then, very abruptly,
she suggested that they go upstairs. From room to room she hurried the
boy, scarcely listening to his ardent comments, or answering his still
more ardent questions. Not until they reached the highest tower room,
indeed, did she sink wearily into a chair, and seem for a moment at
rest.
</P>

<P>
David looked about him in surprise. Even his untrained eye could see
that he had entered a different world. There were no sumptuous rugs, no
silken hangings; no mirrors, no snowflake curtains. There were books,
to be sure, but besides those there were only a plain low table, a
work-basket, and three or four wooden-seated though comfortable chairs.
With increasing wonder he looked into Miss Holbrook's eyes.
</P>

<P>
"Is it here that you stay&mdash;all day?" he asked diffidently.
</P>

<P>
Miss Holbrook's face turned a vivid scarlet.
</P>

<P>
"Why, David, what a question! Of course not! Why should you think I
did?"
</P>

<P>
"Nothing; only I've been wondering all the time I've been here how you
could&mdash;with all those beautiful things around you downstairs&mdash;say what
you did."
</P>

<P>
"Say what?&mdash;when?"
</P>

<P>
"That other day in the garden&mdash;about ALL your hours being cloudy ones.
So I didn't know to-day but what you LIVED up here, same as Mrs. Holly
doesn't use her best rooms; and that was why your hours were all cloudy
ones."
</P>

<P>
With a sudden movement Miss Holbrook rose to her feet.
</P>

<P>
"Nonsense, David! You shouldn't always remember everything that people
say to you. Come, you haven't seen one of the views from the windows
yet. We are in the larger tower, you know. You can see Hinsdale village
on this side, and there's a fine view of the mountains over there. Oh
yes, and from the other side there's your friend's house&mdash;Mr. Jack's.
By the way, how is Mr. Jack these days?" Miss Holbrook stooped as she
asked the question and picked up a bit of thread from the rug.
</P>

<P>
David ran at once to the window that looked toward the House that Jack
Built. From the tower the little house appeared to be smaller than
ever. It was in the shadow, too, and looked strangely alone and
forlorn. Unconsciously, as he gazed at it, David compared it with the
magnificence he had just seen. His voice choked as he answered.
</P>

<P>
"He isn't well, Lady of the Roses, and he's unhappy. He's awfully
unhappy."
</P>

<P>
Miss Holbrook's slender figure came up with a jerk.
</P>

<P>
"What do you mean, boy? How do you know he's unhappy? Has he said so?"
</P>

<P>
"No; but Mrs. Holly told me about him. He's sick; and he'd just found
his work to do out in the world when he had to stop and come home.
But&mdash;oh, quick, there he is! See?"
</P>

<P>
Instead of coming nearer Miss Holbrook fell back to the center of the
room; but her eyes were still turned toward the little house.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, I see," she murmured. The next instant she had snatched a
handkerchief from David's outstretched hand. "No&mdash;no&mdash;I wouldn't wave,"
she remonstrated hurriedly. "Come&mdash;come downstairs with me."
</P>

<P>
"But I thought&mdash;I was sure he was looking this way," asserted David,
turning reluctantly from the window. "And if he HAD seen me wave to
him, he'd have been so glad; now, wouldn't he?"
</P>

<P>
There was no answer. The Lady of the Roses did not apparently hear. She
had gone on down the stairway.

</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
SECRETS
</H3>

<P>
David had so much to tell Jack and Jill that he went to see them the
very next day after his second visit to Sunnycrest. He carried his
violin with him. He found, however, only Jill at home. She was sitting
on the veranda steps.
</P>

<P>
There was not so much embarrassment between them this time, perhaps
because they were in the freedom of the wide out-of-doors, and David
felt more at ease. He was plainly disappointed, however, that Mr. Jack
was not there.
</P>

<P>
"But I wanted to see him! I wanted to see him 'specially," he lamented.
</P>

<P>
"You'd better stay, then. He'll be home by and by," comforted Jill.
"He's gone pot-boiling."
</P>

<P>
"Pot-boiling! What's that?"
</P>

<P>
Jill chuckled.
</P>

<P>
"Well, you see, really it's this way: he sells something to boil in
other people's pots so he can have something to boil in ours, he says.
It's stuff from the garden, you know. We raise it to sell. Poor
Jack&mdash;and he does hate it so!"
</P>

<P>
David nodded sympathetically.
</P>

<P>
"I know&mdash;and it must be awful, just hoeing and weeding all the time."
</P>

<P>
"Still, of course he knows he's got to do it, because it's out of
doors, and he just has to be out of doors all he can," rejoined the
girl. "He's sick, you know, and sometimes he's so unhappy! He doesn't
say much. Jack never says much&mdash;only with his face. But I know, and
it&mdash;it just makes me want to cry."
</P>

<P>
At David's dismayed exclamation Jill jumped to her feet. It owned to
her suddenly that she was telling this unknown boy altogether too many
of the family secrets. She proposed at once a race to the foot of the
hill; and then, to drive David's mind still farther away from the
subject under recent consideration, she deliberately lost, and
proclaimed him the victor.
</P>

<P>
Very soon, however, there arose new complications in the shape of a
little gate that led to a path which, in its turn, led to a footbridge
across the narrow span of the little stream.
</P>

<P>
Above the trees on the other side peeped the top of Sunnycrest's
highest tower.
</P>

<P>
"To the Lady of the Roses!" cried David eagerly. "I know it goes there.
Come, let's see!"
</P>

<P>
The little girl shook her head.
</P>

<P>
"I can't."
</P>

<P>
"Why not?"
</P>

<P>
"Jack won't let me."
</P>

<P>
"But it goes to a beautiful place; I was there yesterday," argued
David. "And I was up in the tower and almost waved to Mr. Jack on the
piazza back there. I saw him. And maybe she'd let you and me go up
there again to-day."
</P>

<P>
"But I can't, I say," repeated Jill, a little impatiently. "Jack won't
let me even start."
</P>

<P>
"Why not? Maybe he doesn't know where it goes to."
</P>

<P>
Jill hung her head. Then she raised it defiantly.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, yes, he does, 'cause I told him. I used to go when I was littler
and he wasn't here. I went once, after he came,&mdash;halfway,&mdash;and he saw
me and called to me. I had got halfway across the bridge, but I had to
come back. He was very angry, yet sort of&mdash;queer, too. His face was all
stern and white, and his lips snapped tight shut after every word. He
said never, never, never to let him find me the other side of that
gate."
</P>

<P>
David frowned as they turned to go up the hill. Unhesitatingly he
determined to instruct Mr. Jack in this little matter. He would tell
him what a beautiful place Sunnycrest was, and he would try to convince
him how very desirable it was that he and Jill, and even Mr. Jack
himself, should go across the bridge at the very first opportunity that
offered.
</P>

<P>
Mr. Jack came home before long, but David quite forgot to speak of the
footbridge just then, chiefly because Mr. Jack got out his violin and
asked David to come in and play a duet with him. The duet, however,
soon became a solo, for so great was Mr. Jack's delight in David's
playing that he placed before the boy one sheet of music after another,
begging and still begging for more.
</P>

<P>
David, nothing loath, played on and on. Most of the music he knew,
having already learned it in his mountain home. Like old friends the
melodies seemed, and so glad was David to see their notes again that he
finished each production with a little improvised cadenza of ecstatic
welcome&mdash;to Mr. Jack's increasing surprise and delight.
</P>

<P>
"Great Scott! you're a wonder, David," he exclaimed, at last.
</P>

<P>
"Pooh! as if that was anything wonderful," laughed the boy. "Why, I
knew those ages ago, Mr. Jack. It's only that I'm so glad to see them
again&mdash;the notes, you know. You see, I haven't any music now. It was
all in the bag (what we brought), and we left that on the way."
</P>

<P>
"You left it!"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, 't was so, heavy" murmured David abstractedly, his fingers busy
with the pile of music before him. "Oh, and here's another one," he
cried exultingly. "This is where the wind sighs, 'oou&mdash;OOU&mdash;OOU'
through the pines. Listen!" And he was away again on the wings of his
violin. When he had returned Mr. Jack drew a long breath.
</P>

<P>
"David, you are a wonder," he declared again. "And that violin of yours
is a wonder, too, if I'm not mistaken,&mdash;though I don't know enough to
tell whether it's really a rare one or not. Was it your father's?"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, no. He had one, too, and they both are good ones. Father said so.
Joe's got father's now."
</P>

<P>
"Joe?"
</P>

<P>
"Joe Glaspell."
</P>

<P>
"You don't mean Widow Glaspell's Joe, the blind boy? I didn't know he
could play."
</P>

<P>
"He couldn't till I showed him. But he likes to hear me play. And he
understood&mdash;right away, I mean."
</P>

<P>
"UNDERSTOOD!"
</P>

<P>
"What I was playing, you know. And he was almost the first one that
did&mdash;since father went away. And now I play every time I go there. Joe
says he never knew before how trees and grass and sunsets and sunrises
and birds and little brooks did look, till I told him with my violin.
Now he says he thinks he can see them better than I can, because as
long as his OUTSIDE eyes can't see anything, they can't see those ugly
things all around him, and so he can just make his INSIDE eyes see only
the beautiful things that he'd LIKE to see. And that's the kind he does
see when I play. That's why I said he understood."
</P>

<P>
For a moment there was silence. In Mr. Jack's eyes there was an odd
look as they rested on David's face. Then, abruptly, he spoke.
</P>

<P>
"David, I wish I had money. I'd put you then where you belonged," he
sighed.
</P>

<P>
"Do you mean&mdash;where I'd find my work to do?" asked the boy softly.
</P>

<P>
"Well&mdash;yes; you might say it that way," smiled the man, after a
moment's hesitation&mdash;not yet was Mr. Jack quite used to this boy who
was at times so very un-boylike.
</P>

<P>
"Father told me 't was waiting for me&mdash;somewhere."
</P>

<P>
Mr. Jack frowned thoughtfully.
</P>

<P>
"And he was right, David. The only trouble is, we like to pick it out
for ourselves, pretty well,&mdash;too well, as we find out sometimes, when
we're called off&mdash;for another job."
</P>

<P>
"I know, Mr. Jack, I know," breathed David. And the man, looking into
the glowing dark eyes, wondered at what he found there. It was almost
as if the boy really understood about his own life's
disappointment&mdash;and cared; though that, of course, could not be!
</P>

<P>
"And it's all the harder to keep ourselves in tune then, too, is n't
it?" went on David, a little wistfully.
</P>

<P>
"In tune?"
</P>

<P>
"With the rest of the Orchestra."
</P>

<P>
"Oh!"  And Mr. Jack, who had already heard about the "Orchestra of
Life," smiled a bit sadly. "That's just it, my boy. And if we're handed
another instrument to play on than the one we WANT to play on, we're
apt to&mdash;to let fly a discord. Anyhow, I am. But"&mdash;he went on more
lightly&mdash;"now, in your case, David, little as I know about the violin,
I know enough to understand that you ought to be where you can take up
your study of it again; where you can hear good music, and where you
can be among those who know enough to appreciate what you do."
</P>

<P>
David's eyes sparkled.
</P>

<P>
"And where there wouldn't be any pulling weeds or hoeing dirt?"
</P>

<P>
"Well, I hadn't thought of including either of those pastimes."
</P>

<P>
"My, but I would like that, Mr. Jack!&mdash;but THAT wouldn't be WORK, so
that couldn't be what father meant." David's face fell.
</P>

<P>
"Hm-m; well, I wouldn't worry about the 'work' part," laughed Mr. Jack,
"particularly as you aren't going to do it just now. There's the money,
you know,&mdash;and we haven't got that."
</P>

<P>
"And it takes money?"
</P>

<P>
"Well&mdash;yes. You can't get those things here in Hinsdale, you know; and
it takes money, to get away, and to live away after you get there."
</P>

<P>
A sudden light transfigured David's face.
</P>

<P>
"Mr. Jack, would gold do it?&mdash;lots of little round gold-pieces?"
</P>

<P>
"I think it would, David, if there were enough of them."
</P>

<P>
"Many as a hundred?"
</P>

<P>
"Sure&mdash;if they were big enough. Anyway, David, they'd start you, and
I'm thinking you wouldn't need but a start before you'd be coining
gold-pieces of your own out of that violin of yours. But why? Anybody
you know got as 'many as a hundred' gold-pieces he wants to get rid of?"
</P>

<P>
For a moment David, his delighted thoughts flying to the gold-pieces in
the chimney cupboard of his room, was tempted to tell his secret. Then
he remembered the woman with the bread and the pail of milk, and
decided not to. He would wait. When he knew Mr. Jack better&mdash;perhaps
then he would tell; but not now.  NOW Mr. Jack might think he was a
thief, and that he could not bear. So he took up his violin and began
to play; and in the charm of the music Mr. Jack seemed to forget the
gold-pieces&mdash;which was exactly what David had intended should happen.
</P>

<P>
Not until David had said good-bye some time later, did he remember the
purpose&mdash;the special purpose&mdash;for which he had come. He turned back
with a radiant face.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, and Mr. Jack, I 'most forgot," he cried. "I was going to tell you.
I saw you yesterday&mdash;I did, and I almost waved to you."
</P>

<P>
"Did you? Where were you?"
</P>

<P>
"Over there in the window&mdash;the tower window" he crowed jubilantly.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, you went again, then, I suppose, to see Miss Holbrook."
</P>

<P>
The man's voice sounded so oddly cold and distant that David noticed it
at once. He was reminded suddenly of the gate and the footbridge which
Jill was forbidden to cross; but he dared not speak of it then&mdash;not
when Mr. Jack looked like that. He did say, however:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"Oh, but, Mr. Jack, it's such a beautiful place! You don't know what a
beautiful place it is."
</P>

<P>
"Is it? Then, you like it so much?"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, so much! But&mdash;didn't you ever&mdash;see it?"
</P>

<P>
 "Why, yes, I believe I did, David, long ago," murmured Mr. Jack<BR>
with what seemed to David amazing indifference.
</P>

<P>
"And did you see HER&mdash;my Lady of the Roses?"
</P>

<P>
"Why, y&mdash;yes&mdash;I believe so."
</P>

<P>
"And is THAT all you remember about it?" resented David, highly
offended.
</P>

<P>
The man gave a laugh&mdash;a little short, hard laugh that David did not
like.
</P>

<P>
"But, let me see; you said you almost waved, didn't you? Why did n't
you, quite?" asked the man.
</P>

<P>
David drew himself suddenly erect. Instinctively he felt that his Lady
of the Roses needed defense.
</P>

<P>
"Because SHE didn't want me to; so I didn't, of course," he rejoined
with dignity. "She took away my handkerchief."
</P>

<P>
"I'll warrant she did," muttered the man, behind his teeth. Aloud he
only laughed again, as he turned away.
</P>

<P>
David went on down the steps, dissatisfied vaguely with himself, with
Mr. Jack, and even with the Lady of the Roses.

CHAPTER XVI
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
DAVID'S CASTLE IN SPAIN
</H3>

<P>
On his return from the House that Jack Built, David decided to count
his gold-pieces. He got them out at once from behind the books, and
stacked them up in little shining rows. As he had surmised, there were
a hundred of them. There were, indeed, a hundred and six. He was
pleased at that. One hundred and six were surely enough to give him a
"start."
</P>

<P>
A start! David closed his eyes and pictured it. To go on with his
violin, to hear good music, to be with people who understood what he
said when he played! That was what Mr. Jack had said a "start" was. And
this gold&mdash;these round shining bits of gold&mdash;could bring him this!
David swept the little piles into a jingling heap, and sprang to his
feet with both fists full of his suddenly beloved wealth. With boyish
glee he capered about the room, jingling the coins in his hands. Then,
very soberly, he sat down again, and began to gather the gold to put
away.
</P>

<P>
He would be wise&mdash;he would be sensible. He would watch his chance, and
when it came he would go away. First, however, he would tell Mr. Jack
and Joe, and the Lady of the Roses; yes, and the Hollys, too. Just now
there seemed to be work, real work that he could do to help Mr. Holly.
But later, possibly when September came and school,&mdash;they had said he
must go to school,&mdash;he would tell them then, and go away instead. He
would see. By that time they would believe him, perhaps, when he showed
the gold-pieces. They would not think he had&mdash;STOLEN them. It was
August now; he would wait. But meanwhile he could think&mdash;he could
always be thinking of the wonderful thing that this gold was one day to
bring to him.
</P>

<P>
Even work, to David, did not seem work now. In the morning he was to
rake hay behind the men with the cart. Yesterday he had not liked it
very well; but now&mdash;nothing mattered now. And with a satisfied sigh
David put his precious gold away again behind the books in the cupboard.
</P>

<P>
David found a new song in his violin the next morning. To be sure, he
could not play it&mdash;much of it&mdash;until four o'clock in the afternoon
came; for Mr. Holly did not like violins to be played in the morning,
even on days that were not especially the Lord's. There was too much
work to do. So David could only snatch a strain or two very, very
softly, while he was dressing; but that was enough to show him what a
beautiful song it was going to be. He knew what it was, at once, too.
It was the gold-pieces, and what they would bring. All through the day
it tripped through his consciousness, and danced tantalizingly just out
of reach. Yet he was wonderfully happy, and the day seemed short in
spite of the heat and the weariness.
</P>

<P>
At four o'clock he hurried home and put his violin quickly in tune. It
came then&mdash;that dancing sprite of tantalization&mdash;and joyously abandoned
itself to the strings of the violin, so that David knew, of a surety,
what a beautiful song it was.
</P>

<P>
It was this song that sent him the next afternoon to see his Lady of
the Roses. He found her this time out of doors in her garden.
Unceremoniously, as usual, he rushed headlong into her presence.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, Lady&mdash;Lady of the Roses," he panted. "I've found out, and I came
quickly to tell you."
</P>

<P>
"Why, David, what&mdash;what do you mean?" Miss Holbrook looked unmistakably
startled.
</P>

<P>
"About the hours, you know,&mdash;the unclouded ones," explained David
eagerly. "You know you said they were ALL cloudy to you."
</P>

<P>
Miss Holbrook's face grew very white.
</P>

<P>
"You mean&mdash;you've found out WHY my hours are&mdash;are all cloudy ones?" she
stammered.
</P>

<P>
"No, oh, no. I can't imagine why they are," returned David, with an
emphatic shake of his head. "It's just that I've found a way to make
all my hours sunny ones, and you can do it, too. So I came to tell you.
You know you said yours were all cloudy."
</P>

<P>
"Oh," ejaculated Miss Holbrook, falling back into her old listless
attitude. Then, with some asperity: "Dear me, David! Did n't I tell you
not to be remembering that all the time?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, I know, but I've LEARNED something," urged the boy; "something
that you ought to know. You see, I did think, once, that because you
had all these beautiful things around you, the hours ought to be all
sunny ones. But now I know it isn't what's around you; it's what is IN
you!"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, David, David, you curious boy!"
</P>

<P>
"No, but really! Let me tell you," pleaded David. "You know I haven't
liked them,&mdash;all those hours till four o'clock came,&mdash;and I was so
glad, after I saw the sundial, to find out that they didn't count,
anyhow. But to-day they HAVE counted&mdash;they've all counted, Lady of the
Roses; and it's just because there was something inside of me that
shone and shone, and made them all sunny&mdash;those hours."
</P>

<P>
"Dear me! And what was this wonderful thing?"
</P>

<P>
David smiled, but he shook his head.
</P>

<P>
"I can't tell you that yet&mdash;in words; but I'll play it. You see, I
can't always play them twice alike,&mdash;those little songs that I
find,&mdash;but this one I can. It sang so long in my head, before my violin
had a chance to tell me what it really was, that I sort of learned it.
Now, listen!" And he began to play.
</P>

<P>
It was, indeed, a beautiful song, and Miss Holbrook said so with
promptness and enthusiasm; yet still David frowned.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, yes," he answered, "but don't you see? That was telling you about
something inside of me that made all my hours sunshiny ones. Now, what
you want is something inside of you to make yours sunshiny, too. Don't
you see?"
</P>

<P>
An odd look came into Miss Holbrook's eyes.
</P>

<P>
"That's all very well for you to say, David, but you haven't told me
yet, you know, just what it is that's made all this brightness for you."
</P>

<P>
The boy changed his position, and puckered his forehead into a deeper
frown.
</P>

<P>
"I don't seem to explain so you can understand," he sighed. "It isn't
the SPECIAL thing. It's only that it's SOMETHING. And it's thinking
about it that does it. Now, mine wouldn't make yours shine,
but&mdash;still,"&mdash;he broke off, a happy relief in his eyes,&mdash;"yours could
be LIKE mine, in one way. Mine is something that is going to happen to
me&mdash;something just beautiful; and you could have that, you
know,&mdash;something that was going to happen to you, to think about."
</P>

<P>
Miss Holbrook smiled, but only with her lips, Her eyes had grown somber.
</P>

<P>
"But there isn't anything 'just beautiful' going to happen to me,
David," she demurred.
</P>

<P>
"There could, couldn't there?"
</P>

<P>
Miss Holbrook bit, her lip; then she gave an odd little laugh that
seemed, in some way, to go with the swift red that had come to her
cheeks.
</P>

<P>
"I used to think there could&mdash;once," she admitted; "but I've given that
up long ago. It&mdash;it didn't happen."
</P>

<P>
"But couldn't you just THINK it was going to?" persisted the boy. "You
see I found out yesterday that it's the THINKING that does it. All day
long I was thinking&mdash;only thinking. I wasn't DOING it, at all. I was
really raking behind the cart; but the hours all were sunny."
</P>

<P>
Miss Holbrook laughed now outright.
</P>

<P>
"What a persistent little mental-science preacher you are!" she
exclaimed. "And there's truth&mdash;more truth than you know&mdash;in it all,
too. But I can't do it, David,&mdash;not that&mdash;not that. 'T would take more
than THINKING&mdash;to bring that," she added, under her breath, as if to
herself.
</P>

<P>
"But thinking does bring things," maintained David earnestly. "There's
Joe&mdash;Joe Glaspell. His mother works out all day; and he's blind."
</P>

<P>
"Blind? Oh-h!" shuddered Miss Holbrook.
</P>

<P>
"Yes; and he has to stay all alone, except for Betty, and she is n't
there much. He THINKS ALL his things. He has to. He can't SEE anything
with his outside eyes. But he sees everything with his inside
eyes&mdash;everything that I play. Why, Lady of the Roses, he's even seen
this&mdash;all this here. I told him about it, you know, right away after
I'd found you that first day: the big trees and the long shadows across
the grass, and the roses, and the shining water, and the lovely marble
people peeping through the green leaves; and the sundial, and you so
beautiful sitting here in the middle of it all. Then I played it for
him; and he said he could see it all just as plain! And THAT was with
his inside eyes! And so, if Joe, shut up there in his dark little room,
can make his THINK bring him all that, I should think that YOU, here in
this beautiful, beautiful place, could make your think bring you
anything you wanted it to."
</P>

<P>
But Miss Holbrook sighed again and shook her head.
</P>

<P>
"Not that, David, not that," she murmured. "It would take more than
thinking to bring&mdash;that." Then, with a quick change of manner, she
cried: "Come, come, suppose we don't worry any more about MY hours.
Let's think of yours. Tell me, what have you been doing since I saw you
last? Perhaps you have been again to&mdash;to see Mr. Jack, for instance."
</P>

<P>
"I have; but I saw Jill mostly, till the last." David hesitated, then
he blurted it out: "Lady of the Roses, do you know about the gate and
the footbridge?"
</P>

<P>
Miss Holbrook looked up quickly.
</P>

<P>
"Know&mdash;what, David?"
</P>

<P>
"Know about them&mdash;that they're there?"
</P>

<P>
"Why&mdash;yes, of course; at least, I suppose you mean the footbridge that
crosses the little stream at the foot of the hill over there."
</P>

<P>
"That's the one." Again David hesitated, and again he blurted out the
burden of his thoughts. "Lady of the Roses, did you ever&mdash;cross that
bridge?"
</P>

<P>
Miss Holbrook stirred uneasily.
</P>

<P>
"Not&mdash;recently."
</P>

<P>
"But you don't MIND folks crossing it?"
</P>

<P>
"Certainly not&mdash;if they wish to."
</P>

<P>
"There! I knew 't wasn't your blame," triumphed David.
</P>

<P>
"MY blame!"
</P>

<P>
"Yes; that Mr. Jack wouldn't let Jill come across, you know. He called
her back when she'd got halfway over once." Miss Holbrook's face
changed color.
</P>

<P>
"But I do object," she cried sharply, "to their crossing it when they
DON'T want to! Don't forget that, please."
</P>

<P>
"But Jill did want to."
</P>

<P>
"How about her brother&mdash;did he want her to?"
</P>

<P>
"N&mdash;no."
</P>

<P>
"Very well, then. I didn't, either."
</P>

<P>
David frowned. Never had he seen his beloved Lady of the Roses look
like this before. He was reminded of what Jill had said about Jack:
"His face was all stern and white, and his lips snapped tight shut
after every word." So, too, looked Miss Holbrook's face; so, too, had
her lips snapped tight shut after her last words. David could not
understand it. He said nothing more, however; but, as was usually the
case when he was perplexed, he picked up his violin and began to play.
And as he played, there gradually came to Miss Holbrook's eyes a softer
light, and to her lips lines less tightly drawn. Neither the footbridge
nor Mr. Jack, however, was mentioned again that afternoon.

CHAPTER XVII
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
"THE PRINCESS AND THE PAUPER"
</H3>

<P>
It was in the early twilight that Mr. Jack told the story. He, Jill,
and David were on the veranda, as usual watching the towers of
Sunnycrest turn from gold to silver as the sun dropped behind the
hills. It was Jill who had asked for the story.
</P>

<P>
"About fairies and princesses, you know," she had ordered.
</P>

<P>
"But how will David like that?" Mr. Jack had demurred. "Maybe he
doesn't care for fairies and princesses."
</P>

<P>
"I read one once about a prince&mdash;'t was 'The Prince and the Pauper,'
and I liked that," averred David stoutly.
</P>

<P>
Mr. Jack smiled; then his brows drew together in a frown. His eyes were
moodily fixed on the towers.
</P>

<P>
"Hm-m; well," he said, "I might, I suppose, tell you a story about a
PRINCESS and&mdash;a Pauper. I&mdash;know one well enough."
</P>

<P>
"Good!&mdash;then tell it," cried both Jill and David. And Mr. Jack began
his story.
</P>

<P>
"She was not always a Princess, and he was not always a Pauper,&mdash;and
that's where the story came in, I suppose," sighed the man. "She was
just a girl, once, and he was a boy; and they played together
and&mdash;liked each other. He lived in a little house on a hill."
</P>

<P>
"Like this?" demanded Jill.
</P>

<P>
"Eh? Oh&mdash;er&mdash;yes, SOMETHING like this," returned Mr. Jack, with an odd
half-smile. "And she lived in another bit of a house in a town far away
from the boy."
</P>

<P>
"Then how could they play together?" questioned David.
</P>

<P>
"They couldn't, ALWAYS. It was only summers when she came to visit in
the boy's town. She was very near him then, for the old aunt whom she
visited lived in a big stone house with towers, on another hill, in
plain sight from the boy's home."
</P>

<P>
"Towers like those&mdash;where the Lady of the Roses lives?" asked David.
</P>

<P>
"Eh? What? Oh&mdash;er&mdash;yes," murmured Mr. Jack. "We'll say the towers were
something like those over there." He paused, then went on musingly:
"The girl used to signal, sometimes, from one of the tower windows. One
wave of the handkerchief meant, 'I'm coming, over'; two waves, with a
little pause between, meant, 'You are to come over here.' So the boy
used to wait always, after that first wave to see if another followed;
so that he might know whether he were to be host or guest that day. The
waves always came at eight o'clock in the morning, and very eagerly the
boy used to watch for them all through the summer when the girl was
there."
</P>

<P>
"Did they always come, every morning?" Asked Jill.
</P>

<P>
"No; sometimes the girl had other things to do. Her aunt would want her
to go somewhere with her, or other cousins were expected whom the girl
must entertain; and she knew the boy did not like other guests to be
there when he was, so she never asked him to come over at such times.
On such occasions she did sometimes run up to the tower at eight
o'clock and wave three times, and that meant, 'Dead Day.' So the boy,
after all, never drew a real breath of relief until he made sure that
no dreaded third wave was to follow the one or the two."
</P>

<P>
"Seems to me," observed David, "that all this was sort of one-sided.
Didn't the boy say anything?"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, yes," smiled Mr. Jack. "But the boy did not have any tower to wave
from, you must remember. He had only the little piazza on his tiny bit
of a house. But he rigged up a pole, and he asked his mother to make
him two little flags, a red and a blue one. The red meant 'All right';
and the blue meant 'Got to work'; and these he used to run up on his
pole in answer to her waving 'I'm coming over,' or 'You are to come
over here.' So, you see, occasionally it was the boy who had to bring
the 'Dead Day,' as there were times when he had to work. And, by the
way, perhaps you would be interested to know that after a while he
thought up a third flag to answer her three waves. He found an old
black silk handkerchief of his father's, and he made that into a flag.
He told the girl it meant 'I'm heartbroken,' and he said it was a sign
of the deepest mourning. The girl laughed and tipped her head saucily
to one side, and said, 'Pooh! as if you really cared!' But the boy
stoutly maintained his position, and it was that, perhaps, which made
her play the little joke one day.
</P>

<P>
"The boy was fourteen that summer, and the girl thirteen. They had
begun their signals years before, but they had not had the black one so
long. On this day that I tell you of, the girl waved three waves, which
meant, 'Dead Day,' you remember, and watched until the boy had hoisted
his black flag which said, 'I'm heart-broken,' in response. Then, as
fast as her mischievous little feet could carry her, she raced down one
hill and across to the other. Very stealthily she advanced till she
found the boy bent over a puzzle on the back stoop, and&mdash;and he was
whistling merrily.
</P>

<P>
"How she teased him then! How she taunted him with 'Heart-broken,
indeed&mdash;and whistling like that!' In vain he blushed and stammered, and
protested that his whistling was only to keep up his spirits. The girl
only laughed and tossed her yellow curls; then she hunted till she
found some little jingling bells, and these she tied to the black badge
of mourning and pulled it high up on the flagpole. The next instant she
was off with a run and a skip, and a saucy wave of her hand; and the
boy was left all alone with an hour's work ahead of him to untie the
knots from his desecrated badge of mourning.
</P>

<P>
"And yet they were wonderfully good friends&mdash;this boy and girl. From
the very first, when they were seven and eight, they had said that they
would marry each other when they grew up, and always they spoke of it
as the expected thing, and laid many happy plans for the time when it
should come. To be sure, as they grew older, it was not mentioned quite
so often, perhaps; but the boy at least thought&mdash;if he thought of it
all&mdash;that that was only because it was already so well understood."
</P>

<P>
"What did the girl think?" It was Jill who asked the question.
</P>

<P>
"Eh? The girl? Oh," answered Mr. Jack, a little bitterly, "I'm afraid I
don't know exactly what the girl did think, but&mdash;it was n't that,
anyhow&mdash;that is, judging from what followed."
</P>

<P>
"What did follow?"

"Well, to begin with, the old aunt died. The girl was sixteen then. It
was in the winter that this happened, and the girl was far away at
school. She came to the funeral, however, but the boy did not see her,
save in the distance; and then he hardly knew her, so strange did she
look in her black dress and hat. She was there only two days, and
though he gazed wistfully up at the gray tower, he knew well enough
that of course she could not wave to him at such a time as that. Yet he
had hoped&mdash;almost believed that she would wave two waves that last day,
and let him go over to see her.
</P>

<P>
"But she didn't wave, and he didn't go over. She went away. And then
the town learned a wonderful thing. The old lady, her aunt, who had
been considered just fairly rich, turned out to be the possessor of
almost fabulous wealth, owing to her great holdings of stock in a
Western gold mine which had suddenly struck it rich. And to the girl
she willed it all. It was then, of course, that the girl became the
Princess, but the boy did not realize that&mdash;just then. To him she was
still 'the girl.'
</P>

<P>
"For three years he did not see her. She was at school, or traveling
abroad, he heard. He, too, had been away to school, and was, indeed,
just ready to enter college. Then, that summer, he heard that she was
coming to the old home, and his heart sang within him. Remember, to him
she was still the girl. He knew, of course, that she was not the LITTLE
girl who had promised to marry him. But he was sure she was the merry
comrade, the true-hearted young girl who used to smile frankly into his
eyes, and whom he was now to win for his wife. You see he had
forgotten&mdash;quite forgotten about the Princess and the money. Such a
foolish, foolish boy as he was!
</P>

<P>
"So he got out his flags gleefully, and one day, when his mother wasn't
in the kitchen, he ironed out the wrinkles and smoothed them all ready
to be raised on the pole. He would be ready when the girl waved&mdash;for of
course she would wave; he would show her that he had not forgotten. He
could see just how the sparkle would come to her eyes, and just how the
little fine lines of mischief would crinkle around her nose when she
was ready to give that first wave. He could imagine that she would like
to find him napping; that she would like to take him by surprise, and
make him scurry around for his flags to answer her.
</P>

<P>
"But he would show her! As if she, a girl, were to beat him at their
old game! He wondered which it would be: 'I'm coming over,' or, 'You
are to come over here.' Whichever it was, he would answer, of course,
with the red 'All right.' Still, it WOULD be a joke to run up the blue
'Got to work,' and then slip across to see her, just as she, so long
ago, had played the joke on him! On the whole, however, he thought the
red flag would be better. And it was that one which he laid uppermost
ready to his hand, when he arranged them.
</P>

<P>
"At last she came. He heard of it at once. It was already past four
o'clock, but he could not forbear, even then, to look toward the tower.
It would be like her, after all, to wave then, that very night, just so
as to catch him napping, he thought. She did not wave, however. The boy
was sure of that, for he watched the tower till dark.
</P>

<P>
"In the morning, long before eight o'clock, the boy was ready. He
debated for some time whether to stand out of doors on the piazza, or
to hide behind the screened window, where he could still watch the
tower. He decided at last that it would be better not to let her see
him when she looked toward the house; then his triumph would be all the
more complete when he dashed out to run up his answer.
</P>

<P>
"Eight o'clock came and passed. The boy waited until nine, but there
was no sign of life from the tower. The boy was angry then, at himself.
He called himself, indeed, a fool, to hide as he did. Of course she
wouldn't wave when he was nowhere in sight&mdash;when he had apparently
forgotten! And here was a whole precious day wasted!
</P>

<P>
"The next morning, long before eight, the boy stood in plain sight on
the piazza. As before he waited until nine; and as before there was no
sign of life at the tower window. The next morning he was there again,
and the next, and the next. It took just five days, indeed, to convince
the boy&mdash;as he was convinced at last&mdash;that the girl did not intend to
wave at all."
</P>

<P>
"But how unkind of her!" exclaimed David.
</P>

<P>
"She couldn't have been nice one bit!" decided Jill.
</P>

<P>
"You forget," said Mr. Jack. "She was the Princess."
</P>

<P>
"Huh!" grunted Jill and David in unison.
</P>

<P>
"The boy remembered it then," went on Mr. Jack, after a pause,&mdash;"about
the money, and that she was a Princess. And of course he knew&mdash;when he
thought of it&mdash;that he could not expect that a Princess would wave like
a girl&mdash;just a girl. Besides, very likely she did not care particularly
about seeing him. Princesses did forget, he fancied,&mdash;they had so much,
so very much to fill their lives. It was this thought that kept him
from going to see her&mdash;this, and the recollection that, after all, if
she really HAD wanted to see him, she could have waved.
</P>

<P>
"There came a day, however, when another youth, who did not dare to go
alone, persuaded him, and together they paid her a call. The boy
understood, then, many things. He found the Princess; there was no sign
of the girl. The Princess was tall and dignified, with a cold little
hand and a smooth, sweet voice. There was no frank smile in her eyes,
neither were there any mischievous crinkles about her nose and lips.
There was no mention of towers or flags; no reference to wavings or to
childhood's days. There was only a stiffly polite little conversation
about colleges and travels, with a word or two about books and plays.
Then the callers went home. On the way the boy smiled scornfully to
himself. He was trying to picture the beauteous vision he had seen,
this unapproachable Princess in her filmy lace gown,&mdash;standing in the
tower window and waving&mdash;waving to a bit of a house on the opposite
hill. As if that could happen!
</P>

<P>
"The boy, during those last three years, had known only books. He knew
little of girls&mdash;only one girl&mdash;and he knew still less of Princesses.
So when, three days after the call, there came a chance to join a
summer camp with a man who loved books even better than did the boy
himself, he went gladly. Once he had refused to go on this very trip;
but then there had been the girl. Now there was only the Princess&mdash;and
the Princess didn't count."
</P>

<P>
"Like the hours that aren't sunshiny," interpreted David.
</P>

<P>
"Yes," corroborated Mr. Jack. "Like the hours when the sun does n't
shine."
</P>

<P>
"And then?" prompted Jill.
</P>

<P>
"Well, then,&mdash;there wasn't much worth telling," rejoined Mr. Jack
gloomily. "Two more years passed, and the Princess grew to be
twenty-one. She came into full control of her property then, and after
a while she came back to the old stone house with the towers and turned
it into a fairyland of beauty. She spent money like water. All manner
of artists, from the man who painted her ceilings to the man who
planted her seeds, came and bowed to her will. From the four corners of
the earth she brought her treasures and lavished them through the house
and grounds. Then, every summer, she came herself, and lived among
them, a very Princess indeed."
</P>

<P>
"And the boy?&mdash;what became of the boy?" demanded David. "Didn't he see
her&mdash;ever?"
</P>

<P>
Mr. Jack shook his head.
</P>

<P>
"Not often, David; and when he did, it did not make him any&mdash;happier.
You see, the boy had become the Pauper; you must n't forget that."
</P>

<P>
"But he wasn't a Pauper when you left him last."
</P>

<P>
"Wasn't he? Well, then, I'll tell you about that. You see, the boy,
even though he did go away, soon found out that in his heart the
Princess was still the girl, just the same. He loved her, and he wanted
her to be his wife; so for a little&mdash;for a very little&mdash;he was wild
enough to think that he might work and study and do great things in the
world until he was even a Prince himself, and then he could marry the
Princess."
</P>

<P>
"Well, couldn't he?"
</P>

<P>
"No. To begin with, he lost his health. Then, away back in the little
house on the hill something happened&mdash;a something that left a very
precious charge for him to keep; and he had to go back and keep it, and
to try to see if he couldn't find that lost health, as well. And that
is all."
</P>

<P>
"All! You don't mean that that is the end!" exclaimed Jill.
</P>

<P>
"That's the end."
</P>

<P>
"But that isn't a mite of a nice end," complained David. "They always
get married and live happy ever after&mdash;in stories."
</P>

<P>
"Do they?" Mr. Jack smiled a little sadly. "Perhaps they do, David,&mdash;in
stories."
</P>

<P>
"Well, can't they in this one?"
</P>

<P>
"I don't see how."
</P>

<P>
"Why can't he go to her and ask her to marry him?"
</P>

<P>
Mr. Jack drew himself up proudly.
</P>

<P>
"The Pauper and the Princess? Never! Paupers don't go to Princesses,
David, and say, 'I love you.'"
</P>

<P>
David frowned.
</P>

<P>
"Why not? I don't see why&mdash;if they want to do it. Seems as if somehow
it might be fixed."
</P>

<P>
"It can't be," returned Mr. Jack, his gaze on the towers that crowned
the opposite hill; "not so long as always before the Pauper's eyes
there are those gray walls behind which he pictures the Princess in the
midst of her golden luxury."
</P>

<P>
To neither David nor Jill did the change to the present tense seem
strange. The story was much too real to them for that.
</P>

<P>
"Well, anyhow, I think it ought to be fixed," declared David, as he
rose to his feet.
</P>

<P>
"So do I&mdash;but we can't fix it," laughed Jill. "And I'm hungry. Let's
see what there is to eat!"

CHAPTER XVIII
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
DAVID TO THE RESCUE
</H3>

<P>
It was a beautiful moonlight night, but for once David was not thinking
of the moon. All the way to the Holly farmhouse he was thinking of Mr.
Jack's story, "The Princess and the Pauper." It held him strangely. He
felt that he never could forget it. For some reason that he could not
have explained, it made him sad, too, and his step was very quiet as he
went up the walk toward the kitchen door.
</P>

<P>
It was after eight o'clock. David had taken supper with Mr. Jack and
Jill, and not for some hours had he been at the farmhouse. In the
doorway now he stopped short; then instinctively he stepped back into
the shadow. In the kitchen a kerosene light was burning. It showed Mrs.
Holly crying at the table, and Mr. Holly, white-faced and stern-lipped,
staring at nothing. Then Mrs. Holly raised her face, drawn and
tear-stained, and asked a trembling question.
</P>

<P>
"Simeon, have you thought? We might go&mdash;to John&mdash;for&mdash;help."
</P>

<P>
David was frightened then, so angry was the look that came into Simeon
Holly's face.
</P>

<P>
"Ellen, we'll have no more of this," said the man harshly. "Understand,
I'd rather lose the whole thing and&mdash;and starve, than go to&mdash;John."
</P>

<P>
David fled then. Up the back stairs he crept to his room and left his
violin. A moment later he stole down again and sought Perry Larson whom
he had seen smoking in the barn doorway.
</P>

<P>
"Perry, what is it?" he asked in a trembling voice. "What has
happened&mdash;in there?" He pointed toward the house.
</P>

<P>
The man puffed for a moment in silence before he took his pipe from his
mouth.
</P>

<P>
"Well, sonny, I s'pose I may as well tell ye. You'll have ter know it
sometime, seein' as 't won't be no secret long. They've had a stroke o'
bad luck&mdash;Mr. an' Mis' Holly has."
</P>

<P>
"What is it?"
</P>

<P>
The man hitched in his seat.
</P>

<P>
"By sugar, boy, I s'pose if I tell ye, there ain't no sartinty that
you'll sense it at all. I reckon it ain't in your class."
</P>

<P>
"But what is it?"
</P>

<P>
"Well, it's money&mdash;and one might as well talk moonshine to you as
money, I s'pose; but here goes it. It's a thousand dollars, boy, that
they owed. Here, like this," he explained, rummaging his pockets until
he had found a silver dollar to lay on his open palm. "Now, jest
imagine a thousand of them; that's heaps an' heaps&mdash;more 'n I ever see
in my life."
</P>

<P>
"Like the stars?" guessed David.
</P>

<P>
The man nodded.
</P>

<P>
"Ex-ACTLY! Well, they owed this&mdash;Mr. an' Mis' Holly did&mdash;and they had
agreed ter pay it next Sat'day. And they was all right, too. They had
it plum saved in the bank, an' was goin' ter draw it Thursday, ter make
sure. An' they was feelin' mighty pert over it, too, when ter-day along
comes the news that somethin's broke kersmash in that bank, an' they've
shet it up. An' nary a cent can the Hollys git now&mdash;an' maybe never.
Anyhow, not 'fore it's too late for this job."
</P>

<P>
"But won't he wait?&mdash;that man they owe it to? I should think he'd have
to, if they didn't have it to pay."
</P>

<P>
"Not much he will, when it's old Streeter that's got the mortgage on a
good fat farm like this!"
</P>

<P>
David drew his brows together perplexedly.
</P>

<P>
"What is a&mdash;a mortgage?" he asked. "Is it anything like a
porte-cochere? I KNOW what that is, 'cause my Lady of the Roses has
one; but we haven't got that&mdash;down here."
</P>

<P>
Perry Larson sighed in exasperation.
</P>

<P>
"Gosh, if that ain't 'bout what I expected of ye! No, it ain't even
second cousin to a&mdash;a-that thing you're a-talkin' of. In plain wordin',
it's jest this: Mr. Holly, he says ter Streeter: 'You give me a
thousand dollars and I'll pay ye back on a sartin day; if I don't pay,
you can sell my farm fur what it'll bring, an' TAKE yer pay. Well, now
here 't is. Mr. Holly can't pay, an' so Streeter will put up the farm
fur sale."
</P>

<P>
"What, with Mr. and Mrs. Holly LIVING here?"
</P>

<P>
"Sure! Only they'll have ter git out, ye know."
</P>

<P>
"Where'll they go?"
</P>

<P>
"The Lord knows; I don't."
</P>

<P>
"And is THAT what they're crying for&mdash;in there?&mdash;because they've got to
go?"
</P>

<P>
"Sure!"
</P>

<P>
"But isn't there anything, anywhere, that can be done to&mdash;stop it?"
</P>

<P>
"I don't see how, kid,&mdash;not unless some one ponies up with the money
'fore next Sat'day,&mdash;an' a thousand o' them things don't grow on ev'ry
bush," he finished, gently patting the coin in his hand.
</P>

<P>
At the words a swift change came to David's face. His cheeks paled and
his eyes dilated in terror. It was as if ahead of him he saw a yawning
abyss, eager to engulf him.
</P>

<P>
"And you say&mdash;MONEY would&mdash;fix it?" he asked thickly.
</P>

<P>
"Ex-ACT-ly!&mdash;a thousand o' them, though, 't would take."
</P>

<P>
A dawning relief came into David's eyes&mdash;it was as if he saw a bridge
across the abyss.
</P>

<P>
"You mean&mdash;that there wouldn't ANYTHING do, only silver pieces&mdash;like
those?" he questioned hopefully.
</P>

<P>
"Sugar, kid, 'course there would! Gosh, but you BE a checkerboard o'
sense an' nonsense, an' no mistake! Any money would do the job&mdash;any
money! Don't ye see? Anything that's money."
</P>

<P>
"Would g-gold do it?" David's voice was very faint now.
</P>

<P>
"Sure!&mdash;gold, or silver, or greenbacks, or&mdash;or a check, if it had the
dough behind it."
</P>

<P>
David did not appear to hear the last. With an oddly strained look he
had hung upon the man's first words; but at the end of the sentence he
only murmured, "Oh, thank you," and turned away. He was walking slowly
now toward the house. His head was bowed. His step lagged.
</P>

<P>
"Now, ain't that jest like that chap," muttered the man, "ter slink off
like that as if he was a whipped cur. I'll bet two cents an' a
doughnut, too, that in five minutes he'll be what he calls 'playin' it'
on that 'ere fiddle o' his. An' I'll be derned, too, if I ain't curious
ter see what he WILL make of it. It strikes me this ought ter fetch
somethin' first cousin to a dirge!"
</P>

<P>
On the porch steps David paused a breathless instant. From the kitchen
came the sound of Mrs. Holly's sobs and of a stern voice praying. With
a shudder and a little choking cry the boy turned then and crept softly
upstairs to his room.
</P>

<P>
He played, too, as Perry Larson had wagered. But it was not the tragedy
of the closed bank, nor the honor of the threatened farm-selling that
fell from his violin. It was, instead, the swan song of a little pile
of gold&mdash;gold which lay now in a chimney cupboard, but which was soon
to be placed at the feet of the mourning man and woman downstairs. And
in the song was the sob of a boy who sees his house of dreams burn to
ashes; who sees his wonderful life and work out in the wide world turn
to endless days of weed-pulling and dirt-digging in a narrow valley.
There was in the song, too, something of the struggle, the fierce yea
and nay of the conflict. But, at the end, there was the wild burst of
exaltation of renunciation, so that the man in the barn door below
fairly sprang to his feet with an angry:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"Gosh! if he hain't turned the thing into a jig&mdash;durn him! Don't he
know more'n that at such a time as this?"
</P>

<P>
Later, a very little later, the shadowy figure of the boy stood before
him.
</P>

<P>
"I've been thinking," stammered David, "that maybe I&mdash;could help, about
that money, you know."
</P>

<P>
"Now, look a-here, boy," exploded Perry, in open exasperation, "as I
said in the first place, this ain't in your class. 'T ain't no pink
cloud sailin' in the sky, nor a bluebird singin' in a blackb'rry bush.
An' you might 'play it'&mdash;as you call it&mdash;till doomsday, an' 't wouldn't
do no good&mdash;though I'm free ter confess that your playin' of them 'ere
other things sounds real pert an' chirky at times; but 't won't do no
good here."
</P>

<P>
David stepped forward, bringing his small, anxious face full into the
moonlight.
</P>

<P>
"But 't was the money, Perry; I meant about, the money," he explained.
"They were good to me and wanted me when there wasn't any one else that
did; and now I'd like to do something for them. There aren't so MANY
pieces, and they aren't silver. There's only one hundred and six of
them; I counted. But maybe they 'd help some. It&mdash;it would be
a&mdash;start." His voice broke over the once beloved word, then went on
with renewed strength. "There, see! Would these do?" And with both
hands he held up to view his cap sagging under its weight of gold.
</P>

<P>
Perry Larson's jaw fell open. His eyes bulged. Dazedly he reached out
and touched with trembling fingers the heap of shining disks that
seemed in the mellow light like little earth-born children of the moon
itself. The next instant he recoiled sharply.
</P>

<P>
"Great snakes, boy, where'd you git that money?" he demanded.
</P>

<P>
"Of father. He went to the far country, you know."
</P>

<P>
Perry Larson snorted angrily.
</P>

<P>
"See here, boy, for once, if ye can, talk horse-sense! Surely, even YOU
don't expect me ter believe that he's sent you that money from&mdash;from
where he's gone to!"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, no. He left it."
</P>

<P>
"Left it! Why, boy, you know better! There wa'n't a cent&mdash;hardly&mdash;found
on him."
</P>

<P>
"He gave it to me before&mdash;by the roadside."
</P>

<P>
"Gave it to you! Where in the name of goodness has it been since?"
</P>

<P>
"In the little cupboard in my room, behind the books."
</P>

<P>
"Great snakes!" muttered Perry Larson, reaching out his hand and
gingerly picking up one of the gold-pieces.
</P>

<P>
David eyed him anxiously.
</P>

<P>
"Won't they&mdash;do?" he faltered. "There aren't a thousand; there's only a
hundred and six; but&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"Do!" cut in the man, excitedly. He had been examining the gold-piece
at close range. "Do! Well, I reckon they'll do. By Jiminy!&mdash;and ter
think you've had this up yer sleeve all this time! Well, I'll believe
anythin' of yer now&mdash;anythin'! You can't stump me with nuthin'! Come
on." And he hurriedly led the way toward the house.
</P>

<P>
"But they weren't up my sleeve," corrected David, as he tried to keep
up with the long strides of the man. "I SAID they were in the cupboard
in my room."
</P>

<P>
There was no answer. Larson had reached the porch steps, and had paused
there hesitatingly. From the kitchen still came the sound of sobs.
Aside from that there was silence. The boy, however, did not hesitate.
He went straight up the steps and through the open kitchen door. At the
table sat the man and the woman, their eyes covered with their hands.
</P>

<P>
With a swift overturning of his cap, David dumped his burden onto the
table, and stepped back respectfully.
</P>

<P>
"If you please, sir, would this&mdash;help any?" he asked.
</P>

<P>
At the jingle of the coins Simeon Holly and his wife lifted their heads
abruptly. A half-uttered sob died on the woman's lips. A quick cry came
from the man's. He reached forth an eager hand and had almost clutched
the gold when a sudden change came to his face. With a stern
ejaculation he drew back.
</P>

<P>
"Boy, where did that money come from?" he challenged.
</P>

<P>
David sighed in a discouraged way. It seemed that, always, the showing
of this gold mean't questioning&mdash;eternal questioning.
</P>

<P>
"Surely," continued Simeon Holly, "you did not&mdash;" With the boy's frank
gaze upturned to his, the man could not finish his sentence.
</P>

<P>
Before David could answer came the voice of Perry Larson from the
kitchen doorway.
</P>

<P>
"No, sir, he didn't, Mr. Holly; an' it's all straight, I'm
thinkin'&mdash;though I'm free ter confess it does sound nutty. His dad give
it to him."
</P>

<P>
"His&mdash;father! But where&mdash;where has it been ever since?"
</P>

<P>
"In the chimney cupboard in his room, he says, sir."
</P>

<P>
Simeon Holly turned in frowning amazement.
</P>

<P>
"David, what does this mean? Why have you kept this gold in a place
like that?"
</P>

<P>
"Why, there wasn't anything else to do with it," answered the boy
perplexedly. "I hadn't any use for it, you know, and father said to
keep it till I needed it."
</P>

<P>
"'Hadn't any use for it'!" blustered Larson from the doorway. "Jiminy!
Now, ain't that jest like that boy?"
</P>

<P>
But David hurried on with his explanation.
</P>

<P>
"We never used to use them&mdash;father and I&mdash;except to buy things to eat
and wear; and down here YOU give me those, you know."
</P>

<P>
"Gorry!" interjected Perry Larson. "Do you reckon, boy, that Mr. Holly
himself was give them things he gives ter you?"
</P>

<P>
The boy turned sharply, a startled question in his eyes.
</P>

<P>
"What do you mean? Do you mean that&mdash;" His face changed suddenly. His
cheeks turned a shamed red. "Why, he did&mdash;he did have to buy them, of
course, just as father did. And I never even thought of it before!
Then, it's yours, anyway&mdash;it belongs to you," he argued, turning to
Farmer Holly, and shoving the gold nearer to his hands. "There isn't
enough, maybe&mdash;but 't will help!"
</P>

<P>
"They're ten-dollar gold pieces, sir," spoke up Larson importantly;
"an' there's a hundred an' six of them. That's jest one thousand an'
sixty dollars, as I make it."
</P>

<P>
Simeon Holly, self-controlled man that he was, almost leaped from his
chair.
</P>

<P>
"One thousand and sixty dollars!" he gasped. Then, to David: "Boy, in
Heaven's name, who are you?"
</P>

<P>
"I don't know&mdash;only David." The boy spoke wearily, with a grieved sob
in his voice. He was very tired, a good deal perplexed, and a little
angry. He wished, if no one wanted this gold, that he could take it
upstairs again to the chimney cupboard; or, if they objected to that,
that they would at least give it to him, and let him go away now to
that beautiful music he was to hear, and to those kind people who were
always to understand what he said when he played.
</P>

<P>
"Of course," ventured Perry Larson diffidently, "I ain't professin' ter
know any great shakes about the hand of the Lord, Mr. Holly, but it do
strike me that this 'ere gold comes mighty near bein'
proverdential&mdash;fur you."
</P>

<P>
Simeon Holly fell back in his seat. His eyes clung to the gold, but his
lips set into rigid lines.
</P>

<P>
"That money is the boy's, Larson. It isn't mine," he said.
</P>

<P>
"He's give it to ye."
</P>

<P>
Simeon Holly shook his head.
</P>

<P>
"David is nothing but a child, Perry. He doesn't realize at all what he
is doing, nor how valuable his gift is."
</P>

<P>
"I know, sir, but you DID take him in, when there wouldn't nobody else
do it," argued Larson. "An', anyhow, couldn't you make a kind of an I O
U of it, even if he is a kid? Then, some day you could pay him back.
Meanwhile you'd be a-keepin' him, an' a-schoolin' him; an' that's
somethin'."
</P>

<P>
"I know, I know," nodded Simeon Holly thoughtfully, his eyes going from
the gold to David's face. Then, aloud, yet as if to himself, he
breathed: "Boy, boy, who was your father? How came he by all that
gold&mdash;and he&mdash;a tramp!"
</P>

<P>
David drew himself suddenly erect. His eyes flashed.
</P>

<P>
"I don't know, sir. But I do know this: he didn't STEAL it!"
</P>

<P>
Across the table Mrs. Holly drew a quick breath, but she did not
speak&mdash;save with her pleading eyes. Mrs. Holly seldom spoke&mdash;save with
her eyes&mdash;when her husband was solving a knotty problem. She was
dumfounded now that he should listen so patiently to the man,
Larson,&mdash;though she was not more surprised than was Larson himself. For
both of them, however, there came at this moment a still greater
surprise. Simeon Holly leaned forward suddenly, the stern lines quite
gone from his lips, and his face working with emotion as he drew David
toward him.
</P>

<P>
"You're a good son, boy,&mdash;a good loyal son; and&mdash;and I wish you were
mine! I believe you. He didn't steal it, and I won't steal it, either.
But I will use it, since you are so good as to offer it. But it shall
be a loan, David, and some day, God helping me, you shall have it back.
Meanwhile, you're my boy, David,&mdash;my boy!"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, thank you, sir," rejoiced David. "And, really, you know, being
wanted like that is better than the start would be, isn't it?"
</P>

<P>
"Better than&mdash;what?"
</P>

<P>
David shifted his position. He had not meant to say just that.
</P>

<P>
"N&mdash;nothing," he stammered, looking about for a means of quick escape.
"I&mdash;I was just talking," he finished. And he was immeasurably relieved
to find that Mr. Holly did not press the matter further.

CHAPTER XIX
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
THE UNBEAUTIFUL WORLD
</H3>

<P>
In spite of the exaltation of renunciation, and in spite of the joy of
being newly and especially "wanted," those early September days were
sometimes hard for David. Not until he had relinquished all hope of his
"start" did he fully realize what that hope had meant to him.
</P>

<P>
There were times, to be sure, when there was nothing but rejoicing
within him that he was able thus to aid the Hollys. There were other
times when there was nothing but the sore heartache because of the
great work out in the beautiful world that could now never be done; and
because of the unlovely work at hand that must be done. To tell the
truth, indeed, David's entire conception of life had become suddenly a
chaos of puzzling contradictions.
</P>

<P>
To Mr. Jack, one day, David went with his perplexities. Not that he
told him of the gold-pieces and of the unexpected use to which they had
been put&mdash;indeed, no. David had made up his mind never, if he could
help himself, to mention those gold-pieces to any one who did not
already know of them. They meant questions, and the questions,
explanations. And he had had enough of both on that particular subject.
But to Mr. Jack he said one day, when they were alone together:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"Mr. Jack, how many folks have you got inside of your head?"
</P>

<P>
"Eh&mdash;what, David?"
</P>

<P>
David repeated his question and attached an explanation.
</P>

<P>
"I mean, the folks that&mdash;that make you do things."
</P>

<P>
Mr. Jack laughed.
</P>

<P>
"Well," he said, "I believe some people make claims to quite a number,
and perhaps almost every one owns to a Dr. Jekyll and a Mr. Hyde."
</P>

<P>
"Who are they?"
</P>

<P>
"Never mind, David. I don't think you know the gentlemen, anyhow.
They're only something like the little girl with a curl. One is very,
very good, indeed, and the other is horrid."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, yes, I know them; they're the ones that come to me," returned
David, with a sigh. "I've had them a lot, lately."
</P>

<P>
Mr. Jack stared.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, have you?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes; and that's what's the trouble. How can you drive them off&mdash;the
one that is bad, I mean?"
</P>

<P>
"Well, really," confessed Mr. Jack, "I'm not sure I can tell. You
see&mdash;the gentlemen visit me sometimes."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, do they?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes."
</P>

<P>
"I'm so glad&mdash;that is, I mean," amended David, in answer to Mr. Jack's
uplifted eyebrows, "I'm glad that you understand what I'm talking
about. You see, I tried Perry Larson last night on it, to get him to
tell me what to do. But he only stared and laughed. He didn't know the
names of 'em, anyhow, as you do, and at last he got really almost angry
and said I made him feel so 'buggy' and 'creepy' that he wouldn't dare
look at himself in the glass if I kept on, for fear some one he'd never
known was there should jump out at him."
</P>

<P>
Mr. Jack chuckled.
</P>

<P>
"Well, I suspect, David, that Perry knew one of your gentlemen by the
name of 'conscience,' perhaps; and I also suspect that maybe conscience
does pretty nearly fill the bill, and that you've been having a bout
with that. Eh? Now, what is the trouble? Tell me about it."
</P>

<P>
David stirred uneasily. Instead of answering, he asked another question.
</P>

<P>
"Mr. Jack, it is a beautiful world, isn't it?"
</P>

<P>
For a moment there was no, answer; then a low voice replied:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"Your father said it was, David."
</P>

<P>
Again David moved restlessly.
</P>

<P>
"Yes; but father was on the mountain. And down here&mdash;well, down here
there are lots of things that I don't believe he knew about."
</P>

<P>
"What, for instance?"
</P>

<P>
"Why, lots of things&mdash;too many to tell. Of course there are things like
catching fish, and killing birds and squirrels and other things to eat,
and plaguing cats and dogs. Father never would have called those
beautiful. Then there are others like little Jimmy Clark who can't
walk, and the man at the Marstons' who's sick, and Joe Glaspell who is
blind. Then there are still different ones like Mr. Holly's little boy.
Perry says he ran away years and years ago, and made his people very
unhappy. Father wouldn't call that a beautiful world, would he? And how
can people like that always play in tune? And there are the Princess
and the Pauper that you told about."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, the story?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes; and people like them can't be happy and think the world is
beautiful, of course."
</P>

<P>
"Why not?"
</P>

<P>
"Because they didn't end right. They didn't get married and live happy
ever after, you know."
</P>

<P>
"Well, I don't think I'd worry about that, David,&mdash;at least, not about
the Princess. I fancy the world was very beautiful to her, all right.
The Pauper&mdash;well, perhaps he wasn't very happy. But, after all, David,
you know happiness is something inside of yourself. Perhaps half of
these people are happy, in their way."
</P>

<P>
"There! and that's another thing," sighed David. "You see, I found that
out&mdash;that it was inside of yourself&mdash;quite a while ago, and I told the
Lady of the Roses. But now I&mdash;can't make it work myself."
</P>

<P>
"What's the matter?"
</P>

<P>
"Well, you see then something was going to happen&mdash;something that I
liked; and I found that just thinking of it made it so that I didn't
mind raking or hoeing, or anything like that; and I told the Lady of
the Roses. And I told her that even if it wasn't going to happen she
could THINK it was going to, and that that would be just the same,
because 't was the thinking that made my hours sunny ones. It wasn't
the DOING at all. I said I knew because I hadn't DONE it yet. See?"
</P>

<P>
"I&mdash;think so, David."
</P>

<P>
"Well, I've found out that it isn't the same at all; for now that I
KNOW that this beautiful thing isn't ever going to happen to me, I can
think and think all day, and it doesn't do a mite of good. The sun is
just as hot, and my back aches just as hard, and the field is just as
big and endless as it used to be when I had to call it that those hours
didn't count. Now, what is the matter?"
</P>

<P>
Mr. Jack laughed, but he shook his head a little sadly.
</P>

<P>
"You're getting into too deep waters for me, David. I suspect you're
floundering in a sea that has upset the boats of sages since the world
began. But what is it that was so nice, and that isn't going to happen?
Perhaps I MIGHT help on that."
</P>

<P>
"No, you couldn't," frowned David; "and there couldn't anybody, either,
you see, because I wouldn't go back now and LET it happen, anyhow, as
long as I know what I do. Why, if I did, there wouldn't be ANY hours
that were sunny then&mdash;not even the ones after four o'clock; I&mdash;I'd feel
so mean! But what I don't see is just how I can fix it up with the Lady
of the Roses."
</P>

<P>
"What has she to do with it?"
</P>

<P>
"Why, at the very first, when she said she didn't have ANY sunshiny
hours, I told her&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"When she said what?" interposed Mr. Jack, coming suddenly erect in his
chair.
</P>

<P>
"That she didn't have any hours to count, you know."
</P>

<P>
"To&mdash;COUNT?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes; it was the sundial. Didn't I tell you? Yes, I know I did&mdash;about
the words on it&mdash;not counting any hours that weren't sunny, you know.
And she said she wouldn't have ANY hours to count; that the sun never
shone for her."
</P>

<P>
"Why, David," demurred Mr. Jack in a voice that shook a little, "are
you sure? Did she say just that? You&mdash;you must be mistaken&mdash;when she
has&mdash;has everything to make her happy."
</P>

<P>
"I wasn't, because I said that same thing to her myself&mdash;afterwards.
And then I told her&mdash;when I found out myself, you know&mdash;about its being
what was inside of you, after all, that counted; and then is when I
asked her if she couldn't think of something nice that was going to
happen to her sometime."
</P>

<P>
"Well, what did she say?"
</P>

<P>
"She shook her head, and said 'No.' Then she looked away, and her eyes
got soft and dark like little pools in the brook where the water stops
to rest. And she said she had hoped once that this something would
happen; but that it hadn't, and that it would take something more than
thinking to bring it. And I know now what she meant, because thinking
isn't all that counts, is it?"
</P>

<P>
Mr. Jack did not answer. He had risen to his feet, and was pacing
restlessly up and down the veranda. Once or twice he turned his eyes
toward the towers of Sunnycrest, and David noticed that there was a new
look on his face.
</P>

<P>
Very soon, however, the old tiredness came back to his eyes, and he
dropped into his seat again, muttering "Fool! of course it couldn't
be&mdash;that!"
</P>

<P>
"Be what?" asked David.
</P>

<P>
Mr. Jack started.
</P>

<P>
"Er&mdash;nothing; nothing that you would understand, David. Go on&mdash;with
what you were saying."
</P>

<P>
"There isn't any more. It's all done. It's only that I'm wondering how
I'm going to learn here that it's a beautiful world, so that I
can&mdash;tell father."
</P>

<P>
Mr. Jack roused himself. He had the air of a man who determinedly
throws to one side a heavy burden.
</P>

<P>
"Well, David," he smiled, "as I said before, you are still out on that
sea where there are so many little upturned boats. There might be a
good many ways of answering that question."
</P>

<P>
"Mr. Holly says," mused the boy, aloud, a little gloomily, "that it
doesn't make any difference whether we find things beautiful or not;
that we're here to do something serious in the world."
</P>

<P>
"That is about what I should have expected of Mr. Holly" retorted Mr.
Jack grimly. "He acts it&mdash;and looks it. But&mdash;I don't believe you are
going to tell your father just that."
</P>

<P>
"No, sir, I don't believe I am," accorded David soberly.
</P>

<P>
"I have an idea that you're going to find that answer just where your
father said you would&mdash;in your violin. See if you don't. Things that
aren't beautiful you'll make beautiful&mdash;because we find what we are
looking for, and you're looking for beautiful things. After all, boy,
if we march straight ahead, chin up, and sing our own little song with
all our might and main, we shan't come so far amiss from the goal, I'm
thinking. There! that's preaching, and I didn't mean to preach;
but&mdash;well, to tell the truth, that was meant for myself, for&mdash;I'm
hunting for the beautiful world, too."
</P>

<P>
"Yes, sir, I know," returned David fervently. And again Mr. Jack,
looking into the sympathetic, glowing dark eyes, wondered if, after
all, David really could&mdash;know.
</P>

<P>
Even yet Mr. Jack was not used to David; there were "so many of him,"
he told himself. There were the boy, the artist, and a third
personality so evanescent that it defied being named. The boy was
jolly, impetuous, confidential, and delightful&mdash;plainly reveling in all
manner of fun and frolic. The artist was nothing but a bunch of nervous
alertness, ready to find melody and rhythm in every passing thought or
flying cloud. The third&mdash;that baffling third that defied the
naming&mdash;was a dreamy, visionary, untouchable creature who floated so
far above one's head that one's hand could never pull him down to get a
good square chance to see what he did look like. All this thought Mr.
Jack as he gazed into David's luminous eyes.
</P>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
CHAPTER XX
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
THE UNFAMILIAR WAY
</H3>

<P>
In September David entered the village school. School and David did not
assimilate at once. Very confidently the teacher set to work to grade
her new pupil; but she was not so confident when she found that while
in Latin he was perilously near herself (and in French&mdash;which she was
not required to teach&mdash;disastrously beyond her!), in United States
history he knew only the barest outlines of certain portions, and could
not name a single battle in any of its wars. In most studies he was far
beyond boys of his own age, yet at every turn she encountered these
puzzling spots of discrepancy, which rendered grading in the ordinary
way out of the question.
</P>

<P>
David's methods of recitation, too, were peculiar, and somewhat
disconcerting. He also did not hesitate to speak aloud when he chose,
nor to rise from his seat and move to any part of the room as the whim
seized him. In time, of course, all this was changed; but it was
several days before the boy learned so to conduct himself that he did
not shatter to atoms the peace and propriety of the schoolroom.
</P>

<P>
Outside of school David had little work to do now, though there were
still left a few light tasks about the house. Home life at the Holly
farmhouse was the same for David, yet with a difference&mdash;the difference
that comes from being really wanted instead of being merely dutifully
kept. There were other differences, too, subtle differences that did
not show, perhaps, but that still were there.
</P>

<P>
Mr. and Mrs. Holly, more than ever now, were learning to look at the
world through David's eyes. One day&mdash;one wonderful day&mdash;they even went
to walk in the woods with the boy; and whenever before had Simeon Holly
left his work for so frivolous a thing as a walk in the woods!
</P>

<P>
It was not accomplished, however, without a struggle, as David could
have told. The day was a Saturday, clear, crisp, and beautiful, with a
promise of October in the air; and David fairly tingled to be free and
away. Mrs. Holly was baking&mdash;and the birds sang unheard outside her
pantry window. Mr. Holly was digging potatoes&mdash;and the clouds sailed
unnoticed above his head.
</P>

<P>
All the morning David urged and begged. If for once, just this once,
they would leave everything and come, they would not regret it, he was
sure. But they shook their heads and said, "No, no, impossible!" In the
afternoon the pies were done and the potatoes dug, and David urged and
pleaded again. If once, only this once, they would go to walk with him
in the woods, he would be so happy, so very happy! And to please the
boy&mdash;they went.
</P>

<P>
It was a curious walk. Ellen Holly trod softly, with timid feet. She
threw hurried, frightened glances from side to side. It was plain that
Ellen Holly did not know how to play. Simeon Holly stalked at her
elbow, stern, silent, and preoccupied. It was plain that Simeon Holly
not only did not know how to play, but did not even care to find out.
</P>

<P>
The boy tripped ahead and talked. He had the air of a monarch
displaying his kingdom. On one side was a bit of moss worthy of the
closest attention; on another, a vine that carried allurement in every
tendril. Here was a flower that was like a story for interest, and
there was a bush that bore a secret worth the telling. Even Simeon
Holly glowed into a semblance of life when David had unerringly picked
out and called by name the spruce, and fir, and pine, and larch, and
then, in answer to Mrs. Holly's murmured: "But, David, where's the
difference? They look so much alike!" he had said:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"Oh, but they aren't, you know. Just see how much more pointed at the
top that fir is than that spruce back there; and the branches grow
straight out, too, like arms, and they're all smooth and tapering at
the ends like a pussy-cat's tail. But the spruce back there&mdash;ITS
branches turned down and out&mdash;didn't you notice?&mdash;and they're all bushy
at the ends like a squirrel's tail. Oh, they're lots different! That's
a larch 'way ahead&mdash;that one with the branches all scraggly and close
down to the ground. I could start to climb that easy; but I couldn't
that pine over there. See, it's 'way up, up, before there's a place for
your foot! But I love pines. Up there on the mountains where I lived,
the pines were so tall that it seemed as if God used them sometimes to
hold up the sky."
</P>

<P>
And Simeon Holly heard, and said nothing; and that he did say
nothing&mdash;especially nothing in answer to David's confident assertions
concerning celestial and terrestrial architecture&mdash;only goes to show
how well, indeed, the man was learning to look at the world through
David's eyes.
</P>

<P>
Nor were these all of David's friends to whom Mr. and Mrs. Holly were
introduced on that memorable walk. There were the birds, and the
squirrels, and, in fact, everything that had life. And each one he
greeted joyously by name, as he would greet a friend whose home and
habits he knew. Here was a wonderful woodpecker, there was a beautiful
bluejay. Ahead, that brilliant bit of color that flashed across their
path was a tanager. Once, far up in the sky, as they crossed an open
space, David spied a long black streak moving southward.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, see!" he exclaimed. "The crows! See them?&mdash;'way up there? Wouldn't
it be fun if we could do that, and fly hundreds and hundreds of miles,
maybe a thousand?"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, David," remonstrated Mrs. Holly, unbelievingly.
</P>

<P>
"But they do! These look as if they'd started on their winter journey
South, too; but if they have, they're early. Most of them don't go till
October. They come back in March, you know. Though I've had them, on
the mountain, that stayed all the year with me."
</P>

<P>
"My! but I love to watch them go," murmured David, his eyes following
the rapidly disappearing blackline. "Lots of birds you can't see, you
know, when they start for the South. They fly at night&mdash;the woodpeckers
and orioles and cuckoos, and lots of others. They're afraid, I guess,
don't you? But I've seen them. I've watched them. They tell each other
when they're going to start."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, David," remonstrated Mrs. Holly, again, her eyes reproving, but
plainly enthralled.
</P>

<P>
"But they do tell each other," claimed the boy, with sparkling eyes.
"They must! For, all of a sudden, some night, you'll hear the signal,
and then they'll begin to gather from all directions. I've seen them.
Then, suddenly, they're all up and off to the South&mdash;not in one big
flock, but broken up into little flocks, following one after another,
with such a beautiful whir of wings. Oof&mdash;OOF&mdash;OOF!&mdash;and they're gone!
And I don't see them again till next year. But you've seen the
swallows, haven't you? They go in the daytime, and they're the easiest
to tell of any of them. They fly so swift and straight. Haven't you
seen the swallows go?"
</P>

<P>
"Why, I&mdash;I don't know, David," murmured Mrs. Holly, with a helpless
glance at her husband stalking on ahead. "I&mdash;I didn't know there were
such things to&mdash;to know."
</P>

<P>
There was more, much more, that David said before the walk came to an
end. And though, when it did end, neither Simeon Holly nor his wife
said a word of its having been a pleasure or a profit, there was yet on
their faces something of the peace and rest and quietness that belonged
to the woods they had left.
</P>

<P>
It was a beautiful month&mdash;that September, and David made the most of
it. Out of school meant out of doors for him. He saw Mr. Jack and Jill
often. He spent much time, too, with the Lady of the Roses. She was
still the Lady of the ROSES to David, though in the garden now were the
purple and scarlet and yellow of the asters, salvia, and golden glow,
instead of the blush and perfume of the roses.
</P>

<P>
David was very much at home at Sunnycrest. He was welcome, he knew, to
go where he pleased. Even the servants were kind to him, as well as was
the elderly cousin whom he seldom saw, but who, he knew, lived there as
company for his Lady of the Roses.
</P>

<P>
Perhaps best, next to the garden, David loved the tower room; possibly
because Miss Holbrook herself so often suggested that they go there.
And it was there that they were when he said, dreamily, one day:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"I like this place&mdash;up here so high, only sometimes it does make me
think of that Princess, because it was in a tower like this that she
was, you know."
</P>

<P>
"Fairy stories, David?" asked Miss Holbrook lightly.
</P>

<P>
"No, not exactly, though there was a Princess in it. Mr. Jack told it."
David's eyes were still out of the window.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, Mr. Jack! And does Mr. Jack often tell you stories?"
</P>

<P>
"No. He never told only this one&mdash;and maybe that's why I remember it
so."
</P>

<P>
"Well, and what did the Princess do?" Miss Holbrook's voice was still
light, still carelessly preoccupied. Her attention, plainly, was given
to the sewing in her hand.
</P>

<P>
"She didn't do and that's what was the trouble," sighed I David. "She
didn't wave, you know."
</P>

<P>
The needle in Miss Holbrook's fingers stopped short in mid-air, the
thread half-drawn.
</P>

<P>
"Didn't&mdash;wave!" she stammered. "What do you&mdash;mean?"
</P>

<P>
"Nothing," laughed the boy, turning away from the window. "I forgot
that you didn't know the story."
</P>

<P>
"But maybe I do&mdash;that is&mdash;what was the story?" asked Miss Holbrook,
wetting her lips as if they had grown suddenly very dry.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, do you? I wonder now! It wasn't 'The PRINCE and the Pauper,' but
the PRINCESS and the Pauper," cited David; "and they used to wave
signals, and answer with flags. Do you know the story?"
</P>

<P>
There was no answer. Miss Holbrook was putting away her work,
hurriedly, and with hands that shook. David noticed that she even
pricked herself in her anxiety to get the needle tucked away. Then she
drew him to a low stool at her side.
</P>

<P>
"David, I want you to tell me that story, please," she said, "just as
Mr. Jack told it to you. Now, be careful and put it all in, because
I&mdash;I want to hear it," she finished, with an odd little laugh that
seemed to bring two bright red spots to her cheeks.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, do you want to hear it? Then I will tell it," cried David
joyfully. To David, almost as delightful as to hear a story was to tell
one himself. "You see, first&mdash;" And he plunged headlong into the
introduction.
</P>

<P>
David knew it well&mdash;that story: and there was, perhaps, little that he
forgot. It might not have been always told in Mr. Jack's language; but
his meaning was there, and very intently Miss Holbrook listened while
David told of the boy and the girl, the wavings, and the flags that
were blue, black, and red. She laughed once,&mdash;that was at the little
joke with the bells that the girl played,&mdash;but she did not speak until
sometime later when David was telling of the first home-coming of the
Princess, and of the time when the boy on his tiny piazza watched and
watched in vain for a waving white signal from the tower.
</P>

<P>
"Do you mean to say," interposed Miss Holbrook then, almost starting to
her feet, "that that boy expected&mdash;" She stopped suddenly, and fell
back in her chair. The two red spots on her cheeks had become a rosy
glow now, all over her face.
</P>

<P>
"Expected what?" asked David.
</P>

<P>
"N&mdash;nothing. Go on. I was so&mdash;so interested," explained Miss Holbrook
faintly. "Go on."
</P>

<P>
And David did go on; nor did the story lose by his telling. It gained,
indeed, something, for now it had woven through it the very strong
sympathy of a boy who loved the Pauper for his sorrow and hated the
Princess for causing that sorrow.
</P>

<P>
"And so," he concluded mournfully, "you see it isn't a very nice story,
after all, for it didn't end well a bit. They ought to have got married
and lived happy ever after. But they didn't."
</P>

<P>
Miss Holbrook drew in her breath a little uncertainly, and put her hand
to her throat. Her face now, instead of being red, was very white.
</P>

<P>
"But, David," she faltered, after a moment, "perhaps
he&mdash;the&mdash;Pauper&mdash;did not&mdash;not love the Princess any longer."
</P>

<P>
"Mr. Jack said that he did."
</P>

<P>
The white face went suddenly pink again.
</P>

<P>
"Then, why didn't he go to her and&mdash;and&mdash;tell her?"
</P>

<P>
David lifted his chin. With all his dignity he answered, and his words
and accent were Mr. Jack's.
</P>

<P>
"Paupers don't go to Princesses, and say 'I love you.'"
</P>

<P>
"But perhaps if they did&mdash;that is&mdash;if&mdash;" Miss Holbrook bit her lips and
did not finish her sentence. She did not, indeed, say anything more for
a long time. But she had not forgotten the story. David knew that,
because later she began to question him carefully about many little
points&mdash;points that he was very sure he had already made quite plain.
She talked about it, indeed, until he wondered if perhaps she were
going to tell it to some one else sometime. He asked her if she were;
but she only shook her head. And after that she did not question him
any more. And a little later David went home.

CHAPTER XXI
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
HEAVY HEARTS
</H3>

<P>
For a week David had not been near the House that Jack Built, and that,
too, when Jill had been confined within doors for several days with a
cold. Jill, indeed, was inclined to be grieved at this apparent lack of
interest on the part of her favorite playfellow; but upon her return
from her first day of school, after her recovery, she met her brother
with startled eyes.
</P>

<P>
"Jack, it hasn't been David's fault at all," she cried remorsefully.
"He's sick."
</P>

<P>
"Sick!"
</P>

<P>
"Yes; awfully sick. They've had to send away for doctors and
everything."
</P>

<P>
"Why, Jill, are you sure? Where did you hear this?"
</P>

<P>
"At school to-day. Every one was talking about it."
</P>

<P>
"But what is the matter?"
</P>

<P>
"Fever&mdash;some sort. Some say it's typhoid, and some scarlet, and some
say another kind that I can't remember; but everybody says he's awfully
sick. He got it down to Glaspell's, some say,&mdash;and some say he didn't.
But, anyhow, Betty Glaspell has been sick with something, and they
haven't let folks in there this week," finished Jill, her eyes big with
terror.
</P>

<P>
"The Glaspells? But what was David doing down there?"
</P>

<P>
"Why, you know,&mdash;he told us once,&mdash;teaching Joe to play. He's been
there lots. Joe is blind, you know, and can't see, but he just loves
music, and was crazy over David's violin; so David took down his other
one&mdash;the one that was his father's, you know&mdash;and showed him how to
pick out little tunes, just to take up his time so he wouldn't mind so
much that he couldn't see. Now, Jack, wasn't that just like David?
Jack, I can't have anything happen to David!"
</P>

<P>
"No, dear, no; of course not! I'm afraid we can't any of us, for that
matter," sighed Jack, his forehead drawn into anxious lines. "I'll go
down to the Hollys', Jill, the first thing tomorrow morning, and see
how he is and if there's anything we can do. Meanwhile, don't take it
too much to heart, dear. It may not be half so bad as you think.
School-children always get things like that exaggerated, you must
remember," he finished, speaking with a lightness that he did not feel.
</P>

<P>
To himself the man owned that he was troubled, seriously troubled. He
had to admit that Jill's story bore the earmarks of truth; and
overwhelmingly he realized now just how big a place this somewhat
puzzling small boy had come to fill in his own heart. He did not need
Jill's anxious "Now, hurry, Jack," the next morning to start him off in
all haste for the Holly farmhouse. A dozen rods from the driveway he
met Perry Larson and stopped him abruptly.
</P>

<P>
"Good morning, Larson; I hope this isn't true&mdash;what I hear&mdash;that David
is very ill."
</P>

<P>
Larson pulled off his hat and with his free hand sought the one
particular spot on his head to which he always appealed when he was
very much troubled.
</P>

<P>
"Well, yes, sir, I'm afraid 't is, Mr. Jack&mdash;er&mdash;Mr. Gurnsey, I mean.
He is turrible sick, poor little chap, an' it's too bad&mdash;that's what it
is&mdash;too bad!"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, I'm sorry! I hoped the report was exaggerated. I came down to see
if&mdash;if there wasn't something I could do."
</P>

<P>
"Well, 'course you can ask&mdash;there ain't no law ag'in' that; an' ye
needn't be afraid, neither. The report has got 'round that it's
ketchin'&mdash;what he's got, and that he got it down to the Glaspells'; but
't ain't so. The doctor says he didn't ketch nothin', an' he can't give
nothin'. It's his head an' brain that ain't right, an' he's got a
mighty bad fever. He's been kind of flighty an' nervous, anyhow, lately.
</P>

<P>
"As I was sayin', 'course you can ask, but I'm thinkin' there won't be
nothin' you can do ter help. Ev'rythin' that can be done is bein' done.
In fact, there ain't much of anythin' else that is bein' done down
there jest now but, tendin' ter him. They've got one o' them 'ere
edyercated nurses from the Junction&mdash;what wears caps, ye know, an'
makes yer feel as if they knew it all, an' you didn't know nothin'. An'
then there's Mr. an' Mis' Holly besides. If they had THEIR way, there
wouldn't neither of, em let him out o' their sight fur a minute,
they're that cut up about it."
</P>

<P>
"I fancy they think a good deal of the boy&mdash;as we all do," murmured the
younger man, a little unsteadily.
</P>

<P>
Larson winkled his forehead in deep thought.
</P>

<P>
"Yes; an' that's what beats me," he answered slowly; "'bout HIM,&mdash;Mr.
Holly, I mean. 'Course we'd 'a' expected it of HER&mdash;losin' her own boy
as she did, an' bein' jest naturally so sweet an' lovin'-hearted. But
HIM&mdash;that's diff'rent. Now, you know jest as well as I do what Mr.
Holly is&mdash;every one does, so I ain't sayin' nothin' sland'rous. He's a
good man&mdash;a powerful good man; an' there ain't a squarer man goin' ter
work fur. But the fact is, he was made up wrong side out, an' the seams
has always showed bad&mdash;turrible bad, with ravelin's all stickin' out
every which way ter ketch an' pull. But, gosh! I'm blamed if that, ere
boy ain't got him so smoothed down, you wouldn't know, scursely, that
he had a seam on him, sometimes; though how he's done it beats me. Now,
there's Mis' Holly&mdash;she's tried ter smooth 'em, I'll warrant, lots of
times. But I'm free ter say she hain't never so much as clipped a
ravelin' in all them forty years they've lived tergether. Fact is, it's
worked the other way with her. All that HER rubbin' up ag'in' them
seams has amounted to is ter git herself so smoothed down that she
don't never dare ter say her soul's her own, most generally,&mdash;anyhow,
not if he happens ter intermate it belongs ter anybody else!"
</P>

<P>
Jack Gurnsey suddenly choked over a cough.
</P>

<P>
"I wish I could&mdash;do something," he murmured uncertainly.
</P>

<P>
"'T ain't likely ye can&mdash;not so long as Mr. an' Mis' Holly is on their
two feet. Why, there ain't nothin' they won't do, an' you'll believe
it, maybe, when I tell you that yesterday Mr. Holly, he tramped all
through Sawyer's woods in the rain, jest ter find a little bit of moss
that the boy was callin' for. Think o' that, will ye? Simeon Holly
huntin' moss! An' he got it, too, an' brung it home, an' they say it
cut him up somethin' turrible when the boy jest turned away, and didn't
take no notice. You understand, 'course, sir, the little chap ain't
right in his head, an' so half the time he don't know what he says."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, I'm sorry, sorry!" exclaimed Gurnsey, as he turned away, and
hurried toward the farmhouse.
</P>

<P>
Mrs. Holly herself answered his low knock. She looked worn and pale.
</P>

<P>
"Thank you, sir," she said gratefully, in reply to his offer of
assistance, "but there isn't anything you can do, Mr. Gurnsey. We're
having everything done that can be, and every one is very kind. We have
a very good nurse, and Dr. Kennedy has had consultation with Dr. Benson
from the Junction. They are doing all in their power, of course, but
they say that&mdash;that it's going to be the nursing that will count now."
</P>

<P>
"Then I don't fear for him, surely" declared the man, with fervor.
</P>

<P>
"I know, but&mdash;well, he shall have the very best possible&mdash;of that."
</P>

<P>
"I know he will; but isn't there anything&mdash;anything that I can do?"
</P>

<P>
She shook her head.
</P>

<P>
"No. Of course, if he gets better&mdash;" She hesitated; then lifted her
chin a little higher; "WHEN he gets better," she corrected with
courageous emphasis, "he will want to see you."
</P>

<P>
"And he shall see me," asserted Gurnsey. "And he will be better, Mrs.
Holly,&mdash;I'm sure he will."
</P>

<P>
"Yes, yes, of course, only&mdash;oh, Mr. Jack, he's so sick&mdash;so very sick!
The doctor says he's a peculiarly sensitive nature, and that he thinks
something's been troubling him lately." Her voice broke.
</P>

<P>
"Poor little chap!" Mr. Jack's voice, too, was husky.
</P>

<P>
She looked up with swift gratefulness for his sympathy.
</P>

<P>
"And you loved him, too, I know" she choked. "He talks of you
often&mdash;very often."
</P>

<P>
"Indeed I love him! Who could help it?"
</P>

<P>
"There couldn't anybody, Mr. Jack,&mdash;and that's just it. Now, since he's
been sick, we've wondered more than ever who he is. You see, I can't
help thinking that somewhere he's got friends who ought to know about
him&mdash;now."
</P>

<P>
"Yes, I see," nodded the man.
</P>

<P>
"He isn't an ordinary boy, Mr. Jack. He's been trained in lots of
ways&mdash;about his manners, and at the table, and all that. And lots of
things his father has told him are beautiful, just beautiful! He isn't
a tramp. He never was one. And there's his playing. YOU know how he can
play."
</P>

<P>
"Indeed I do! You must miss his playing, too."
</P>

<P>
"I do; he talks of that, also," she hurried on, working her fingers
nervously together; "but oftenest he&mdash;he speaks of singing, and I can't
quite understand that, for he didn't ever sing, you know."
</P>

<P>
"Singing? What does he say?" The man asked the question because he saw
that it was affording the overwrought little woman real relief to free
her mind; but at the first words of her reply he became suddenly alert.
</P>

<P>
"It's 'his song,' as he calls it, that he talks about, always. It isn't
much&mdash;what he says&mdash;but I noticed it because he always says the same
thing, like this: I'll just hold up my chin and march straight on and
on, and I'll sing it with all my might and main.' And when I ask him
what he's going to sing, he always says, 'My song&mdash;my song,' just like
that. Do you think, Mr. Jack, he did have&mdash;a song?"
</P>

<P>
For a moment the man did not answer. Something in his throat tightened,
and held the words. Then, in a low voice he managed to stammer:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"I think he did, Mrs. Holly, and&mdash;I think he sang it, too." The next
moment, with a quick lifting of his hat and a murmured "I'll call again
soon," he turned and walked swiftly down the driveway.
</P>

<P>
So very swiftly, indeed, was Mr. Jack walking, and so self-absorbed was
he, that he did not see the carriage until it was almost upon him; then
he stepped aside to let it pass. What he saw as he gravely raised his
hat was a handsome span of black horses, a liveried coachman, and a
pair of startled eyes looking straight into his. What he did not see
was the quick gesture with which Miss Holbrook almost ordered her
carriage stopped the minute it had passed him by.

CHAPTER XXII
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
AS PERRY SAW IT
</H3>

<P>
One by one the days passed, and there came from the anxious watchers at
David's bedside only the words, "There's very little change." Often
Jack Gurnsey went to the farmhouse to inquire for the boy. Often, too,
he saw Perry Larson; and Perry was never loath to talk of David. It was
from Perry, indeed, that Gurnsey began to learn some things of David
that he had never known before.
</P>

<P>
"It does beat all," Perry Larson said to him one day, "how many folks
asks me how that boy is&mdash;folks that you'd never think knew him, anyhow,
ter say nothin' of carin' whether he lived or died. Now, there's old
Mis' Somers, fur instance. YOU know what she is&mdash;sour as a lemon an'
puckery as a chokecherry. Well, if she didn't give me yesterday a great
bo-kay o' posies she'd growed herself, an' said they was fur him&mdash;that
they berlonged ter him, anyhow.
</P>

<P>
"'Course, I didn't exactly sense what she meant by that, so I asked her
straight out; an' it seems that somehow, when the boy first come, he
struck her place one day an' spied a great big red rose on one of her
bushes. It seems he had his fiddle, an' he, played it,&mdash;that rose
a-growin' (you know his way!), an' she heard an' spoke up pretty sharp
an' asked him what in time he was doin'. Well, most kids would 'a'
run,&mdash;knowin' her temper as they does,&mdash;but not much David. He stands
up as pert as ye please, an' tells her how happy that red rose must be
ter make all that dreary garden look so pretty; an' then he goes on,
merry as a lark, a-playin' down the hill.
</P>

<P>
"Well, Mis' Somers owned up ter me that she was pretty mad at the time,
'cause her garden did look like tunket, an' she knew it. She said she
hadn't cared ter do a thing with it since her Bessie died that thought
so much of it. But after what David had said, even mad as she was, the
thing kind o' got on her nerves, an' she couldn't see a thing, day or
night, but that red rose a-growin' there so pert an' courageous-like,
until at last, jest ter quiet herself, she fairly had ter set to an'
slick that garden up! She said she raked an' weeded, an' fixed up all
the plants there was, in good shape, an' then she sent down to the
Junction fur some all growed in pots, 'cause 't was too late ter plant
seeds. An, now it's doin' beautiful, so she jest could n't help sendin'
them posies ter David. When I told Mis' Holly, she said she was glad it
happened, 'cause what Mis' Somers needed was somethin' ter git her out
of herself&mdash;an' I'm free ter say she did look better-natured, an' no
mistake,&mdash;kind o' like a chokecherry in blossom, ye might say."
</P>

<P>
"An' then there's the Widder Glaspell," continued Perry, after a pause.
"'Course, any one would expect she'd feel bad, seein' as how good David
was ter her boy&mdash;teachin' him ter play, ye know. But Mis' Glaspell says
Joe jest does take on somethin' turrible, an' he won't tech the fiddle,
though he was plum carried away with it when David was well an'
teachin' of him. An' there's the Clark kid. He's lame, ye know, an' he
thought the world an' all of David's playin'.
</P>

<P>
"'Course, there's you an' Miss Holbrook, always askin' an' sendin'
things&mdash;but that ain't so strange, 'cause you was 'specially his
friends. But it's them others what beats me. Why, some days it's 'most
ev'ry soul I meet, jest askin' how he is, an' sayin' they hopes he'll
git well. Sometimes it's kids that he's played to, an' I'll be
triggered if one of 'em one day didn't have no excuse to offer except
that David had fit him&mdash;'bout a cat, or somethin'&mdash;an' that ever since
then he'd thought a heap of him&mdash;though he guessed David didn't know
it. Listen ter that, will ye!
</P>

<P>
"An' once a woman held me up, an' took on turrible, but all I could git
from her was that he'd sat on her doorstep an' played ter her baby once
or twice;&mdash;as if that was anythin'! But one of the derndest funny ones
was the woman who said she could wash her dishes a sight easier after
she'd a-seen him go by playin'. There was Bill Dowd, too. You know he
really HAS got a screw loose in his head somewheres, an' there ain't
any one but what says he's the town fool, all right. Well, what do ye
think HE said?"
</P>

<P>
Mr. Jack shook his head.
</P>

<P>
"Well, he said he did hope as how nothin' would happen ter that boy
cause he did so like ter see him smile, an' that he always did smile
every time he met him! There, what do ye think o' that?"
</P>

<P>
"Well, I think, Perry," returned Mr. Jack soberly, "that Bill Dowd
wasn't playing the fool, when he said that, quite so much as he
sometimes is, perhaps."
</P>

<P>
"Hm-m, maybe not," murmured Perry Larson perplexedly. "Still, I'm free
ter say I do think 't was kind o' queer." He paused, then slapped his
knee suddenly. "Say, did I tell ye about Streeter&mdash;Old Bill Streeter
an' the pear tree?"
</P>

<P>
Again Mr. Jack shook his head.
</P>

<P>
"Well, then, I'm goin' to," declared the other, with gleeful emphasis.
"An', say, I don't believe even YOU can explain this&mdash;I don't! Well,
you know Streeter&mdash;ev'ry one does, so I ain't sayin' nothin'
sland'rous. He was cut on a bias, an' that bias runs ter money every
time. You know as well as I do that he won't lift his finger unless
there's a dollar stickin' to it, an' that he hain't no use fur anythin'
nor anybody unless there's money in it for him. I'm blamed if I don't
think that if he ever gits ter heaven, he'll pluck his own wings an'
sell the feathers fur what they'll bring."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, Perry!" remonstrated Mr. Jack, in a half-stifled voice.
</P>

<P>
Perry Larson only grinned and went on imperturbably.
</P>

<P>
"Well, seein' as we both understand what he is, I'll tell ye what he
DONE. He called me up ter his fence one day, big as life, an' says he,
'How's the boy?' An' you could 'a' knocked me down with a feather.
Streeter&mdash;a-askin' how a boy was that was sick! An' he seemed ter care,
too. I hain't seen him look so longfaced since&mdash;since he was paid up on
a sartin note I knows of, jest as he was smackin' his lips over a nice
fat farm that was comin' to him!
</P>

<P>
"Well, I was that plum puzzled that I meant ter find out why Streeter
was takin' sech notice, if I hung fur it. So I set to on a little
detective work of my own, knowin', of course, that 't wa'n't no use
askin' of him himself. Well, an' what do you s'pose I found out? If
that little scamp of a boy hadn't even got round him&mdash;Streeter, the
skinflint! He had&mdash;an' he went there often, the neighbors said; an'
Streeter doted on him. They declared that actually he give him a cent
once&mdash;though THAT part I ain't swallerin' yet.
</P>

<P>
"They said&mdash;the neighbors did&mdash;that it all started from the pear
tree&mdash;that big one ter the left of his house. Maybe you remember it.
Well, anyhow, it seems that it's old, an' through bearin' any fruit,
though it still blossoms fit ter kill, every year, only a little late
'most always, an' the blossoms stay on longer'n common, as if they knew
there wa'n't nothin' doin' later. Well, old Streeter said it had got
ter come down. I reckon he suspected it of swipin' some of the
sunshine, or maybe a little rain that belonged ter the tree t'other
side of the road what did bear fruit an' was worth somethin'! Anyhow,
he got his man an' his axe, an' was plum ready ter start in when he
sees David an' David sees him.
</P>

<P>
"'T was when the boy first come. He'd gone ter walk an' had struck this
pear tree, all in bloom,&mdash;an' 'course, YOU know how the boy would
act&mdash;a pear tree, bloomin', is a likely sight, I'll own. He danced and
laughed and clapped his hands,&mdash;he didn't have his fiddle with
him,&mdash;an' carried on like all possessed. Then he sees the man with the
axe, an' Streeter an' Streeter sees him.
</P>

<P>
"They said it was rich then&mdash;Bill Warner heard it all from t'other side
of the fence. He said that David, when he found out what was goin' ter
happen, went clean crazy, an' rampaged on at such a rate that old
Streeter couldn't do nothin' but stand an' stare, until he finally
managed ter growl out: 'But I tell ye, boy, the tree ain't no use no
more!'
</P>

<P>
"Bill says the boy flew all to pieces then. 'No use&mdash;no use!' he cries;
'such a perfectly beautiful thing as that no use! Why, it don't have
ter be any use when it's so pretty. It's jest ter look at an' love, an'
be happy with!' Fancy sayin' that ter old Streeter! I'd like ter seen
his face. But Bill says that wa'n't half what the boy said. He declared
that 't was God's present, anyhow, that trees was; an' that the things
He give us ter look at was jest as much use as the things He give us
ter eat; an' that the stars an' the sunsets an' the snowflakes an' the
little white cloud-boats, an' I don't know what-all, was jest as
important in the Orchestra of Life as turnips an' squashes. An' then,
Billy says, he ended by jest flingin' himself on ter Streeter an'
beggin' him ter wait till he could go back an' git his fiddle so he
could tell him what a beautiful thing that tree was.
</P>

<P>
"Well, if you'll believe it, old Streeter was so plum befuzzled he sent
the man an' the axe away&mdash;an' that tree's a-livin' ter-day&mdash;'t is!" he
finished; then, with a sudden gloom on his face, Larson added, huskily:
"An' I only hope I'll be sayin' the same thing of that boy&mdash;come next
month at this time!"
</P>

<P>
"We'll hope you will," sighed the other fervently.
</P>

<P>
And so one by one the days passed, while the whole town waited and
while in the great airy "parlor bedroom" of the Holly farmhouse one
small boy fought his battle for life. Then came the blackest day and
night of all when the town could only wait and watch&mdash;it had lost its
hope; when the doctors shook their heads and refused to meet Mrs.
Holly's eyes; when the pulse in the slim wrist outside the coverlet
played hide-and-seek with the cool, persistent fingers that sought so
earnestly for it; when Perry Larson sat for uncounted sleepless hours
by the kitchen stove, and fearfully listened for a step crossing the
hallway; when Mr. Jack on his porch, and Miss Holbrook in her tower
widow, went with David down into the dark valley, and came so near the
rushing river that life, with its petty prides and prejudices, could
never seem quite the same to them again.
</P>

<P>
Then, after that blackest day and night, came the dawn&mdash;as the dawns do
come after the blackest of days and nights. In the slender wrist
outside the coverlet the pulse gained and steadied. On the forehead
beneath the nurse's fingers, a moisture came. The doctors nodded their
heads now, and looked every one straight in the eye. "He will live,"
they said. "The crisis is passed." Out by the kitchen stove Perry
Larson heard the step cross the hall and sprang upright; but at the
first glimpse of Mrs. Holly's tear-wet, yet radiant face, he collapsed
limply.
</P>

<P>
"Gosh!" he muttered. "Say, do you know, I didn't s'pose I did care so
much! I reckon I'll go an' tell Mr. Jack. He'll want ter hear."

CHAPTER XXIII
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
PUZZLES
</H3>

<P>
David's convalescence was picturesque, in a way. As soon as he was
able, like a king he sat upon his throne and received his subjects; and
a very gracious king he was, indeed. His room overflowed with flowers
and fruit, and his bed quite groaned with the toys and books and games
brought for his diversion, each one of which he hailed with delight,
from Miss Holbrook's sumptuously bound "Waverley Novels" to little
crippled Jimmy Clark's bag of marbles.
</P>

<P>
Only two things puzzled David: one was why everybody was so good to
him; and the other was why he never could have the pleasure of both Mr.
Jack's and Miss Holbrook's company at the same time.
</P>

<P>
David discovered this last curious circumstance concerning Mr. Jack and
Miss Holbrook very early in his convalescence. It was on the second
afternoon that Mr. Jack had been admitted to the sick-room. David had
been hearing all the latest news of Jill and Joe, when suddenly he
noticed an odd change come to his visitor's face.
</P>

<P>
The windows of the Holly "parlor bedroom" commanded a fine view of the
road, and it was toward one of these windows that Mr. Jack's eyes were
directed. David, sitting up in bed, saw then that down the road was
approaching very swiftly a handsome span of black horses and an open
carriage which he had come to recognize as belonging to Miss Holbrook.
He watched it eagerly now till he saw the horses turn in at the Holly
driveway. Then he gave a low cry of delight.
</P>

<P>
"It's my Lady of the Roses! She's coming to see me. Look! Oh, I'm so
glad! Now you'll see her, and just KNOW how lovely she is. Why, Mr.
Jack, you aren't going NOW!" he broke off in manifest disappointment,
as Mr. Jack leaped to his feet.
</P>

<P>
"I think I'll have to, if you don't mind, David," returned the man, an
oddly nervous haste in his manner. "And YOU won't mind, now that you'll
have Miss Holbrook. I want to speak to Larson. I saw him in the field
out there a minute ago. And I guess I'll slip right through this window
here, too, David. I don't want to lose him; and I can catch him quicker
this way than any other," he finished, throwing up the sash.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, but Mr. Jack, please just wait a minute," begged David. "I wanted
you to see my Lady of the Roses, and&mdash;" But Mr. Jack was already on the
ground outside the low window, and the next minute, with a merry nod
and smile, he had pulled the sash down after him and was hurrying away.
</P>

<P>
Almost at once, then, Miss Holbrook appeared at the bedroom door.
</P>

<P>
"Mrs. Holly said I was to walk right in, David, so here I am," she
began, in a cheery voice. "Oh, you're looking lots better than when I
saw you Monday, young man!"
</P>

<P>
"I am better," caroled David; "and to-day I'm 'specially better,
because Mr. Jack has been here."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, has Mr. Jack been to see you to-day?" There was an indefinable
change in Miss Holbrook's voice.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, right now. Why, he was here when you were driving into the yard."
</P>

<P>
Miss Holbrook gave a perceptible start and looked about her a little
wildly.
</P>

<P>
"Here when&mdash;But I didn't meet him anywhere&mdash;in the hall."
</P>

<P>
"He didn't go through the hall," laughed David gleefully. "He went
right through that window there."
</P>

<P>
"The window!" An angry flush mounted to Miss Holbrook's forehead.
"Indeed, did he have to resort to that to escape&mdash;" She bit her lip and
stopped abruptly.
</P>

<P>
David's eyes widened a little.
</P>

<P>
"Escape? Oh, HE wasn't the one that was escaping. It was Perry. Mr.
Jack was afraid he'd lose him. He saw him out the window there, right
after he'd seen you, and he said he wanted to speak to him and he was
afraid he'd get away. So he jumped right through that window there.
See?"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, yes, I&mdash;see," murmured Miss Holbrook, in a voice David thought was
a little queer.
</P>

<P>
"I wanted him to stay," frowned David uncertainly. "I wanted him to see
you."
</P>

<P>
"Dear me, David, I hope you didn't tell him so."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, yes, I did. But he couldn't stay, even then. You see, he wanted to
catch Perry Larson."
</P>

<P>
"I've no doubt of it," retorted Miss Holbrook, with so much emphasis
that David again looked at her with a slightly disturbed frown.
</P>

<P>
"But he'll come again soon, I'm sure, and then maybe you'll be here,
too. I do so want him to see you, Lady of the Roses!"
</P>

<P>
"Nonsense, David!" laughed Miss Holbrook a little nervously. "Mr.&mdash;Mr.
Gurnsey doesn't want to see me. He's seen me dozens of times."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, yes, he told me he'd seen you long ago," nodded David gravely;
"but he didn't act as if he remembered it much."
</P>

<P>
"Didn't he, indeed!" laughed Miss Holbrook, again flushing a little.
"Well, I'm sure, dear, we wouldn't want to tax the poor gentleman's
memory too much, you know. Come, suppose you see what I've brought
you," she finished gayly.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, what is it?" cried David, as, under Miss Holbrook's swift fingers,
the wrappings fell away and disclosed a box which, upon being opened,
was found to be filled with quantities of oddly shaped bits of pictured
wood&mdash;a jumble of confusion.
</P>

<P>
"It's a jig-saw puzzle, David. All these little pieces fitted together
make a picture, you see. I tried last night and I could n't do it. I
brought it down to see if you could."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, thank you! I'd love to," rejoiced the boy. And in the fascination
of the marvel of finding one fantastic bit that fitted another, David
apparently forgot all about Mr. Jack&mdash;which seemed not unpleasing to
his Lady of the Roses.
</P>

<P>
It was not until nearly a week later that David had his wish of seeing
his Mr. Jack and his Lady of the Roses meet at his bedside. It was the
day Miss Holbrook brought to him the wonderful set of handsomely bound
"Waverley Novels." He was still glorying in his new possession, in
fact, when Mr. Jack appeared suddenly in the doorway.
</P>

<P>
"Hullo my boy, I just&mdash;Oh, I beg your pardon. I supposed you
were&mdash;alone," he stammered, looking very red indeed.
</P>

<P>
"He is&mdash;that is, he will be, soon&mdash;except for you, Mr. Gurnsey," smiled
Miss Holbrook, very brightly. She was already on her feet.
</P>

<P>
"No, no, I beg of you," stammered Mr. Jack, growing still more red.
"Don't let me drive&mdash;that is, I mean, don't go, please. I didn't know.
I had no warning&mdash;I didn't see&mdash;Your carriage was not at the door
to-day."
</P>

<P>
Miss Holbrook's eyebrows rose the fraction of an inch.
</P>

<P>
"I sent it home. I am planning to walk back. I have several calls to
make on the way; and it's high time I was starting. Good-bye, David."
</P>

<P>
"But, Lady, of the Roses, please, please, don't go," besought David,
who had been looking from one to the other in worried dismay. "Why,
you've just come!"
</P>

<P>
But neither coaxing nor argument availed; and before David really knew
just what had happened, he found himself alone with Mr. Jack.
</P>

<P>
Even then disappointment was piled on disappointment, for Mr. Jack's
visit was not the unalloyed happiness it usually was. Mr. Jack himself
was almost cross at first, and then he was silent and restless, moving
jerkily about the room in a way that disturbed David very much.
</P>

<P>
Mr. Jack had brought with him a book; but even that only made matters
worse, for when he saw the beautifully bound volumes that Miss Holbrook
had just left, he frowned, and told David that he guessed he did not
need his gift at all, with all those other fine books. And David could
not seem to make him understand that the one book from him was just
exactly as dear as were the whole set of books that his Lady of the
Roses brought.
</P>

<P>
Certainly it was not a satisfactory visit at all, and for the first
time David was almost glad to have Mr. Jack go and leave him with his
books. The BOOKS, David told himself, he could understand; Mr. Jack he
could not&mdash;to-day.
</P>

<P>
Several times after this David's Lady of the Roses and Mr. Jack
happened to call at the same hour; but never could David persuade these
two friends of his to stay together. Always, if one came and the other
was there, the other went away, in spite of David's protestations that
two people did not tire him at all and his assertions that he often
entertained as many as that at once. Tractable as they were in all
other ways, anxious as they seemed to please him, on this one point
they were obdurate: never would they stay together.
</P>

<P>
They were not angry with each other&mdash;David was sure of that, for they
were always very especially polite, and rose, and stood, and bowed in a
most delightful fashion. Still, he sometimes thought that they did not
quite like each other, for always, after the one went away, the other,
left behind, was silent and almost stern&mdash;if it was Mr. Jack; and
flushed-faced and nervous&mdash;if it was Miss Holbrook. But why this was so
David could not understand.
</P>

<P>
The span of handsome black horses came very frequently to the Holly
farmhouse now, and as time passed they often bore away behind them a
white-faced but happy-eyed boy on the seat beside Miss Holbrook.
</P>

<P>
"My, but I don't see how every one can be so good to me!" exclaimed the
boy, one day, to his Lady of the Roses.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, that's easy, David," she smiled. "The only trouble is to find out
what you want&mdash;you ask for so little."
</P>

<P>
"But I don't need to ask&mdash;you do it all beforehand," asserted the boy,
"you and Mr. Jack, and everybody."
</P>

<P>
"Really? That's good." For a brief moment Miss Holbrook hesitated;
then, as if casually, she asked: "And he tells you stories, too, I
suppose,&mdash;this Mr. Jack,&mdash;just as he used to, doesn't he?"
</P>

<P>
"Well, he never did tell me but one, you know, before; but he's told me
more now, since I've been sick."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, yes, I remember, and that one was 'The Princess and the Pauper,'
wasn't it? Well, has he told you any more&mdash;like&mdash;that?"
</P>

<P>
The boy shook his head with decision.
</P>

<P>
"No, he doesn't tell me any more like that, and&mdash;and I don't want him
to, either."
</P>

<P>
Miss Holbrook laughed a little oddly.
</P>

<P>
"Why, David, what is the matter with that?" she queried.
</P>

<P>
"The ending; it wasn't nice, you know."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, yes, I&mdash;I remember."
</P>

<P>
"I've asked him to change it," went on David, in a grieved voice. "I
asked him just the other day, but he wouldn't."
</P>

<P>
"Perhaps he&mdash;he didn't want to." Miss Holbrook spoke very quickly, but
so low that David barely heard the words.
</P>

<P>
"Didn't want to? Oh, yes, he did! He looked awful sober, and as if he
really cared, you know. And he said he'd give all he had in the world
if he really could change it, but he couldn't."
</P>

<P>
"Did he say&mdash;just that?" Miss Holbrook was leaning forward a little
breathlessly now.
</P>

<P>
"Yes&mdash;just that; and that's the part I couldn't understand," commented
David. "For I don't see why a story&mdash;just a story made up out of
somebody's head&mdash;can't be changed any way you want it. And I told him
so."
</P>

<P>
"Well, and what did he say to that?"
</P>

<P>
"He didn't say anything for a minute, and I had to ask him again. Then
he sat up suddenly, just as if he'd been asleep, you know, and said,
'Eh, what, David?' And then I told him again what I'd said. This time
he shook his head, and smiled that kind of a smile that isn't really a
smile, you know, and said something about a real, true-to-life story's
never having but one ending, and that was a logical ending. Lady of the
Roses, what is a logical ending?"
</P>

<P>
The Lady of the Roses laughed unexpectedly. The two little red spots,
that David always loved to see, flamed into her cheeks, and her eyes
showed a sudden sparkle. When she answered, her words came
disconnectedly, with little laughing breaths between.
</P>

<P>
"Well, David, I&mdash;I'm not sure I can&mdash;tell you. But perhaps I&mdash;can find
out. This much, however, I am sure of: Mr. Jack's logical ending
wouldn't be&mdash;mine!"
</P>

<P>
What she meant David did not know; nor would she tell him when he
asked; but a few days later she sent for him, and very gladly
David&mdash;able now to go where he pleased&mdash;obeyed the summons.
</P>

<P>
It was November, and the garden was bleak and cold; but in the library
a bright fire danced on the hearth, and before this Miss Holbrook drew
up two low chairs.
</P>

<P>
She looked particularly pretty, David thought. The rich red of her
dress had apparently brought out an answering red in her cheeks. Her
eyes were very bright and her lips smiled; yet she seemed oddly nervous
and restless. She sewed a little, with a bit of yellow silk on
white&mdash;but not for long. She knitted with two long ivory needles
flashing in and out of a silky mesh of blue&mdash;but this, too, she soon
ceased doing. On a low stand at David's side she had placed books and
pictures, and for a time she talked of those. Then very abruptly she
asked:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"David, when will you see&mdash;Mr. Jack again&mdash;do you suppose?"
</P>

<P>
"Tomorrow. I'm going up to the House that Jack Built to tea, and I'm to
stay all night. It's Halloween&mdash;that is, it isn't really Halloween,
because it's too late. I lost that, being sick, you know. So we're
going to pretend, and Mr. Jack is going to show me what it is like.
That is what Mr. Jack and Jill always do; when something ails the real
thing, they just pretend with the make-believe one. He's planned lots
of things for Jill and me to do; with nuts and apples and candles, you
know. It's to-morrow night, so I'll see him then."
</P>

<P>
"To-morrow? So&mdash;so soon?" faltered Miss Holbrook. And to David, gazing
at her with wondering eyes, it seemed for a moment almost as if she
were looking about for a place to which she might run and hide. Then
determinedly, as if she were taking hold of something with both hands,
she leaned forward, looked David squarely in the eyes, and began to
talk hurriedly, yet very distinctly.
</P>

<P>
"David, listen. I've something I want you to say to Mr. Jack, and I
want you to be sure and get it just right. It's about the&mdash;the story,
'The Princess and the Pauper,' you know. You can remember, I think, for
you remembered that so well. Will you say it to him&mdash;what I'm going to
tell you&mdash;just as I say it?"
</P>

<P>
"Why, of course I will!" David's promise was unhesitating, though his
eyes were still puzzled.
</P>

<P>
"It's about the&mdash;the ending," stammered Miss Holbrook. "That is, it
may&mdash;it may have something to do with the ending&mdash;perhaps," she
finished lamely. And again David noticed that odd shifting of Miss
Holbrook's gaze as if she were searching for some means of escape.
Then, as before, he saw her chin lift determinedly, as she began to
talk faster than ever.
</P>

<P>
"Now, listen," she admonished him, earnestly.
</P>

<P>
And David listened.

<H3 ALIGN="center">
CHAPTER XXIV
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
A STORY REMODELED
</H3>

<P>
The pretended Halloween was a great success. So very excited, indeed,
did David become over the swinging apples and popping nuts that he
quite forgot to tell Mr. Jack what the Lady of the Roses had said until
Jill had gone up to bed and he himself was about to take from Mr.
Jack's hand the little lighted lamp.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, Mr. Jack, I forgot," he cried then. "There was something I was
going to tell you."
</P>

<P>
"Never mind to-night, David; it's so late. Suppose we leave it until
to-morrow," suggested Mr. Jack, still with the lamp extended in his
hand.
</P>

<P>
"But I promised the Lady of the Roses that I'd say it to-night,"
demurred the boy, in a troubled voice.
</P>

<P>
The man drew his lamp halfway back suddenly.
</P>

<P>
"The Lady of the Roses! Do you mean&mdash;she sent a message&mdash;to ME?" he
demanded.
</P>

<P>
"Yes; about the story, 'The Princess and the Pauper,' you know."
</P>

<P>
With an abrupt exclamation Mr. Jack set the lamp on the table and
turned to a chair. He had apparently lost his haste to go to bed.
</P>

<P>
"See here, David, suppose you come and sit down, and tell me just what
you're talking about. And first&mdash;just what does the Lady of the Roses
know about that&mdash;that 'Princess and the Pauper'?"
</P>

<P>
"Why, she knows it all, of course," returned the boy in surprise. "I
told it to her."
</P>

<P>
"You&mdash;told&mdash;it&mdash;to her!" Mr. Jack relaxed in his chair. "David!"
</P>

<P>
"Yes. And she was just as interested as could be."
</P>

<P>
"I don't doubt it!" Mr. Jack's lips snapped together a little grimly.
</P>

<P>
"Only she didn't like the ending, either."
</P>

<P>
Mr. Jack sat up suddenly.
</P>

<P>
"She didn't like&mdash;David, are you sure? Did she SAY that?"
</P>

<P>
David frowned in thought.
</P>

<P>
"Well, I don't know as I can tell, exactly, but I'm sure she did n't
like it, because just before she told me WHAT to say to you, she said
that&mdash;that what she was going to say would probably have something to
do with the ending, anyway. Still&mdash;" David paused in yet deeper
thought. "Come to think of it, there really isn't anything&mdash;not in what
she said&mdash;that CHANGED that ending, as I can see. They didn't get
married and live happy ever after, anyhow."
</P>

<P>
"Yes, but what did she say?" asked Mr. Jack in a voice that was not
quite steady. "Now, be careful, David, and tell it just as she said it."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, I will," nodded David.  "SHE said to do that, too."
</P>

<P>
"Did she?" Mr. Jack leaned farther forward in his chair. "But tell me,
how did she happen to&mdash;to say anything about it? Suppose you begin at
the beginning&mdash;away back, David. I want to hear it all&mdash;all!"
</P>

<P>
David gave a contented sigh, and settled himself more comfortably.
</P>

<P>
"Well, to begin with, you see, I told her the story long ago, before I
was sick, and she was ever so interested then, and asked lots of
questions. Then the other day something came up&mdash;I've forgotten
how&mdash;about the ending, and I told her how hard I'd tried to have you
change it, but you wouldn't. And she spoke right up quick and said
probably you didn't want to change it, anyhow. But of course I settled
THAT question without any trouble," went on David confidently, "by just
telling her how you said you'd give anything in the world to change it."
</P>

<P>
"And you told her that&mdash;just that, David?" cried the man.
</P>

<P>
"Why, yes, I had to," answered David, in surprise, "else she wouldn't
have known that you DID want to change it. Don't you see?"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, yes! I&mdash;see&mdash;a good deal that I'm thinking you don't," muttered
Mr. Jack, falling back in his chair.
</P>

<P>
"Well, then is when I told her about the logical ending&mdash;what you said,
you know,&mdash;oh, yes! and that was when I found out she did n't like the
ending, because she laughed such a funny little laugh and colored up,
and said that she wasn't sure she could tell me what a logical ending
was, but that she would try to find out, and that, anyhow, YOUR ending
wouldn't be hers&mdash;she was sure of that."
</P>

<P>
"David, did she say that&mdash;really?" Mr. Jack was on his feet now.
</P>

<P>
"She did; and then yesterday she asked me to come over, and she said
some more things,&mdash;about the story, I mean,&mdash;but she didn't say another
thing about the ending. She didn't ever say anything about that except
that little bit I told you of a minute ago."
</P>

<P>
"Yes, yes, but what did she say?" demanded Mr. Jack, stopping short in
his walk up and down the room.
</P>

<P>
"She said: 'You tell Mr. Jack that I know something about that story of
his that perhaps he doesn't. In the first place, I know the Princess a
lot better than he does, and she isn't a bit the kind of girl he's
pictured her."
</P>

<P>
"Yes! Go on&mdash;go on!"
</P>

<P>
"'Now, for instance,' she says, 'when the boy made that call, after the
girl first came back, and when the boy didn't like it because they
talked of colleges and travels, and such things, you tell him that I
happen to know that that girl was just hoping and hoping he'd speak of
the old days and games; but that she could n't speak, of course, when
he hadn't been even once to see her during all those weeks, and when
he'd acted in every way just as if he'd forgotten.'"
</P>

<P>
"But she hadn't waved&mdash;that Princess hadn't waved&mdash;once!" argued Mr.
Jack; "and he looked and looked for it."
</P>

<P>
"Yes, SHE spoke of that," returned David. "But SHE said she shouldn't
think the Princess would have waved, when she'd got to be such a great
big girl as that&mdash;WAVING to a BOY! She said that for her part she
should have been ashamed of her if she had!"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, did she!" murmured Mr. Jack blankly, dropping suddenly into his
chair.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, she did," repeated David, with a little virtuous uplifting of his
chin.
</P>

<P>
It was plain to be seen that David's sympathies had unaccountably met
with a change of heart.
</P>

<P>
"But&mdash;the Pauper&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, yes, and that's another thing," interrupted David. "The Lady of
the Roses said that she didn't like that name one bit; that it wasn't
true, anyway, because he wasn't a pauper. And she said, too, that as
for his picturing the Princess as being perfectly happy in all that
magnificence, he didn't get it right at all. For SHE knew that the
Princess wasn't one bit happy, because she was so lonesome for things
and people she had known when she was just the girl."
</P>

<P>
Again Mr. Jack sprang to his feet. For a minute he strode up and down
the room in silence; then in a shaking voice he asked:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"David, you&mdash;you aren't making all this up, are you? You're saying just
what&mdash;what Miss Holbrook told you to?"
</P>

<P>
"Why, of course, I'm not making it up," protested the boy aggrievedly.
"This is the Lady of the Roses' story&mdash;SHE made it up&mdash;only she talked
it as if 't was real, of course, just as you did. She said another
thing, too. She said that she happened to know that the Princess had
got all that magnificence around her in the first place just to see if
it wouldn't make her happy, but that it hadn't, and that now she had
one place&mdash;a little room&mdash;that was left just as it used to be when she
was the girl, and that she went there and sat very often. And she said
it was right in sight of where the boy lived, too, where he could see
it every day; and that if he hadn't been so blind he could have looked
right through those gray walls and seen that, and seen lots of other
things. And what did she mean by that, Mr. Jack?"
</P>

<P>
"I don't know&mdash;I don't know, David," half-groaned Mr. Jack. "Sometimes
I think she means&mdash;and then I think that can't be&mdash;true."
</P>

<P>
"But do you think it's helped it any&mdash;the story?" persisted the boy.
"She's only talked a little about the Princess. She didn't really
change things any&mdash;not the ending."
</P>

<P>
"But she said it might, David&mdash;she said it might! Don't you remember?"
cried the man eagerly. And to David, his eagerness did not seem at all
strange. Mr. Jack had said before&mdash;long ago&mdash;that he would be very glad
indeed to have a happier ending to this tale. "Think now," continued
the man. "Perhaps she said something else, too. Did she say anything
else, David?"
</P>

<P>
David shook his head slowly.
</P>

<P>
"No, only&mdash;yes, there was a little something, but it doesn't CHANGE
things any, for it was only a 'supposing.' She said: 'Just supposing,
after long years, that the Princess found out about how the boy felt
long ago, and suppose he should look up at the tower some day, at the
old time, and see a ONE&mdash;TWO wave, which meant, "Come over to see me."
Just what do you suppose he would do?' But of course, THAT can't do any
good," finished David gloomily, as he rose to go to bed, "for that was
only a 'supposing.'"
</P>

<P>
"Of course," agreed Mr. Jack steadily; and David did not know that only
stern self-control had forced the steadiness into that voice, nor that,
for Mr. Jack, the whole world had burst suddenly into song.
</P>

<P>
Neither did David, the next morning, know that long before eight
o'clock Mr. Jack stood at a certain window, his eyes unswervingly fixed
on the gray towers of Sunnycrest. What David did know, however, was
that just after eight, Mr. Jack strode through the room where he and
Jill were playing checkers, flung himself into his hat and coat, and
then fairly leaped down the steps toward the path that led to the
footbridge at the bottom of the hill.
</P>

<P>
"Why, whatever in the world ails Jack?" gasped Jill. Then, after a
startled pause, she asked. "David, do folks ever go crazy for joy?
Yesterday, you see, Jack got two splendid pieces of news. One was from
his doctor. He was examined, and he's fine, the doctor says; all well,
so he can go back, now any time, to the city and work. I shall go to
school then, you know,&mdash;a young ladies' school," she finished, a little
importantly.
</P>

<P>
"He's well? How splendid! But what was the other news? You said there
were two; only it couldn't have been nicer than that was; to be
well&mdash;all well!"
</P>

<P>
"The other? Well, that was only that his old place in the city was
waiting for him. He was with a firm of big lawyers, you know, and of
course it is nice to have a place all waiting. But I can't see anything
in those things to make him act like this, now. Can you?"
</P>

<P>
"Why, yes, maybe," declared David. "He's found his work&mdash;don't you
see?&mdash;out in the world, and he's going to do it. I know how I'd feel if
I had found mine that father told me of! Only what I can't understand
is, if Mr. Jack knew all this yesterday, why did n't he act like this
then, instead of waiting till to-day?"
</P>

<P>
"I wonder," said Jill.

CHAPTER XXV
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
THE BEAUTIFUL WORLD
</H3>

<P>
David found many new songs in his violin those early winter days, and
they were very beautiful ones. To begin with, there were all the kindly
looks and deeds that were showered upon him from every side. There was
the first snowstorm, too, with the feathery flakes turning all the
world to fairy whiteness. This song David played to Mr. Streeter, one
day, and great was his disappointment that the man could not seem to
understand what the song said.
</P>

<P>
"But don't you see?" pleaded David. "I'm telling you that it's your
pear-tree blossoms come back to say how glad they are that you didn't
kill them that day."
</P>

<P>
"Pear-tree blossoms&mdash;come back!" ejaculated the old man. "Well, no, I
can't see. Where's yer pear-tree blossoms?"
</P>

<P>
"Why, there&mdash;out of the window&mdash;everywhere," urged the boy.
</P>

<P>
"THERE! By ginger! boy&mdash;ye don't mean&mdash;ye CAN'T mean the SNOW!"
</P>

<P>
"Of course I do! Now, can't you see it? Why, the whole tree was just a
great big cloud of snowflakes. Don't you remember? Well, now it's gone
away and got a whole lot more trees, and all the little white petals
have come dancing down to celebrate, and to tell you they sure are
coming back next year."
</P>

<P>
"Well, by ginger!" exclaimed the man again. Then, suddenly, he threw
back his head with a hearty laugh. David did not quite like the laugh,
neither did he care for the five-cent piece that the man thrust into
his fingers a little later; though&mdash;had David but known it&mdash;both the
laugh and the five-cent piece gift were&mdash;for the uncomprehending man
who gave them&mdash;white milestones along an unfamiliar way.
</P>

<P>
It was soon after this that there came to David the great surprise&mdash;his
beloved Lady of the Roses and his no less beloved Mr. Jack were to be
married at the beginning of the New Year. So very surprised, indeed,
was David at this, that even his violin was mute, and had nothing, at
first, to say about it. But to Mr. Jack, as man to man, David said one
day:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"I thought men, when they married women, went courting. In story-books
they do. And you&mdash;you hardly ever said a word to my beautiful Lady of
the Roses; and you spoke once&mdash;long ago&mdash;as if you scarcely remembered
her at all. Now, what do you mean by that?"
</P>

<P>
And Mr. Jack laughed, but he grew red, too,&mdash;and then he told it
all,&mdash;that it was just the story of "The Princess and the Pauper," and
that he, David, had been the one, as it happened, to do part of their
courting for them.
</P>

<P>
And how David had laughed then, and how he had fairly hugged himself
for joy! And when next he had picked up his violin, what a beautiful,
beautiful song he had found about it in the vibrant strings!
</P>

<P>
It was this same song, as it chanced, that he was playing in his room
that Saturday afternoon when the letter from Simeon Holly's long-lost
son John came to the Holly farmhouse.
</P>

<P>
Downstairs in the kitchen, Simeon Holly stood, with the letter in his
hand.
</P>

<P>
"Ellen, we've got a letter from&mdash;John," he said. That Simeon Holly
spoke of it at all showed how very far along HIS unfamiliar way he had
come since the last letter from John had arrived.
</P>

<P>
"From&mdash;John? Oh, Simeon! From John?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes."
</P>

<P>
Simeon sat down and tried to hide the shaking of his hand as he ran the
point of his knife under the flap of the envelope. "We'll see what&mdash;he
says." And to hear him, one might have thought that letters from John
were everyday occurrences.
</P>

<BR>

<P CLASS="letter">
DEAR FATHER: Twice before I have written [ran the letter], and received
no answer. But I'm going to make one more effort for forgiveness. May I
not come to you this Christmas? I have a little boy of my own now, and
my heart aches for you. I know how I should feel, should he, in years
to come, do as I did.
</P>

<P CLASS="letter">
I'll not deceive you&mdash;I have not given up my art. You told me once to
choose between you and it&mdash;and I chose, I suppose; at least, I ran
away. Yet in the face of all that, I ask you again, may I not come to
you at Christmas? I want you, father, and I want mother. And I want you
to see my boy.
</P>

<BR>

<P>
"Well?" said Simeon Holly, trying to speak with a steady coldness that
would not show how deeply moved he was. "Well, Ellen?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, Simeon, yes!" choked his wife, a world of mother-love and longing
in her pleading eyes and voice. "Yes&mdash;you'll let it be&mdash;'Yes'!"
</P>

<P>
"Uncle Simeon, Aunt Ellen," called David, clattering down the stairs
from his room, "I've found such a beautiful song in my violin, and I'm
going to play it over and over so as to be sure and remember it for
father&mdash;for it is a beautiful world, Uncle Simeon, isn't it? Now,
listen!"
</P>

<P>
And Simeon Holly listened&mdash;but it was not the violin that he heard. It
was the voice of a little curly-headed boy out of the past.
</P>

<P>
When David stopped playing some time later, only the woman sat watching
him&mdash;the man was over at his desk, pen in hand.
</P>

<P>
John, John's wife, and John's boy came the day before Christmas, and
great was the excitement in the Holly farmhouse. John was found to be
big, strong, and bronzed with the outdoor life of many a sketching
trip&mdash;a son to be proud of, and to be leaned upon in one's old age.
Mrs. John, according to Perry Larson, was "the slickest little woman
goin'." According to John's mother, she was an almost unbelievable
incarnation of a long-dreamed-of, long-despaired-of daughter&mdash;sweet,
lovable, and charmingly beautiful. Little John&mdash;little John was
himself; and he could not have been more had he been an angel-cherub
straight from heaven&mdash;which, in fact, he was, in his doting
grandparents' eyes.
</P>

<P>
John Holly had been at his old home less than four hours when he
chanced upon David's violin. He was with his father and mother at the
time. There was no one else in the room. With a sidelong glance at his
parents, he picked up the instrument&mdash;John Holly had not forgotten his
own youth. His violin-playing in the old days had not been welcome, he
remembered.
</P>

<P>
"A fiddle! Who plays?" he asked.
</P>

<P>
"David."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, the boy. You say you&mdash;took him in? By the way, what an odd little
shaver he is! Never did I see a BOY like HIM." Simeon Holly's head came
up almost aggressively.
</P>

<P>
"David is a good boy&mdash;a very good boy, indeed, John. We think a great
deal of him."
</P>

<P>
John Holly laughed lightly, yet his brow carried a puzzled frown. Two
things John Holly had not been able thus far to understand: an
indefinable change in his father, and the position of the boy David, in
the household&mdash;John Holly was still remembering his own repressed youth.
</P>

<P>
"Hm-m," he murmured, softly picking the strings, then drawing across
them a tentative bow. "I've a fiddle at home that I play sometimes. Do
you mind if I&mdash;tune her up?"
</P>

<P>
A flicker of something that was very near to humor flashed from his
father's eyes.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, no. We are used to that&mdash;now." And again John Holly remembered his
youth.
</P>

<P>
"Jove! but he's got the dandy instrument here," cried the player,
dropping his bow after the first half-dozen superbly vibrant tones, and
carrying the violin to the window. A moment later he gave an amazed
ejaculation and turned on his father a dumfounded face.
</P>

<P>
"Great Scott, father! Where did that boy get this instrument? I KNOW
something of violins, if I can't play them much; and this&mdash;! Where DID
he get it?"
</P>

<P>
"Of his father, I suppose. He had it when he came here, anyway."
</P>

<P>
"'Had it when he came'! But, father, you said he was a tramp, and&mdash;oh,
come, tell me, what is the secret behind this? Here I come home and
find calmly reposing on my father's sitting-room table a violin that's
priceless, for all I know. Anyhow, I do know that its value is reckoned
in the thousands, not hundreds: and yet you, with equal calmness, tell
me it's owned by this boy who, it's safe to say, doesn't know how to
play sixteen notes on it correctly, to say nothing of appreciating
those he does play; and who, by your own account, is nothing but&mdash;" A
swiftly uplifted hand of warning stayed the words on his lips. He
turned to see David himself in the doorway.
</P>

<P>
"Come in, David," said Simeon Holly quietly. "My son wants to hear you
play. I don't think he has heard you." And again there flashed from
Simeon Holly's eyes a something very much like humor.
</P>

<P>
With obvious hesitation John Holly relinquished the violin. From the
expression on his face it was plain to be seen the sort of torture he
deemed was before him. But, as if constrained to ask the question, he
did say:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"Where did you get this violin, boy?"
</P>

<P>
"I don't know. We've always had it, ever since I could remember&mdash;this
and the other one."
</P>

<P>
"The OTHER one!"
</P>

<P>
"Father's."
</P>

<P>
"Oh!" He hesitated; then, a little severely, he observed: "This is a
fine instrument, boy,&mdash;a very fine instrument."
</P>

<P>
"Yes," nodded David, with a cheerful smile. "Father said it was. I like
it, too. This is an Amati, but the other is a Stradivarius. I don't
know which I do like best, sometimes, only this is mine."
</P>

<P>
With a half-smothered ejaculation John Holly fell back limply.
</P>

<P>
"Then you&mdash;do&mdash;know?" he challenged.
</P>

<P>
"Know&mdash;what?"
</P>

<P>
"The value of that violin in your hands."
</P>

<P>
There was no answer. The boy's eyes were questioning.
</P>

<P>
"The worth, I mean,&mdash;what it's worth."
</P>

<P>
"Why, no&mdash;yes&mdash;that is, it's worth everything&mdash;to me," answered David,
in a puzzled voice.
</P>

<P>
With an impatient gesture John Holly brushed this aside.
</P>

<P>
"But the other one&mdash;where is that?"
</P>

<P>
"At Joe Glaspell's. I gave it to him to play on, because he had n't
any, and he liked to play so well."
</P>

<P>
"You GAVE it to him&mdash;a Stradivarius!"
</P>

<P>
"I loaned it to him," corrected David, in a troubled voice. "Being
father's, I couldn't bear to give it away. But Joe&mdash;Joe had to have
something to play on."
</P>

<P>
"'Something to play on'! Father, he doesn't mean the River Street
Glaspells?" cried John Holly.
</P>

<P>
"I think he does. Joe is old Peleg Glaspell's grandson." John Holly
threw up both his hands.
</P>

<P>
"A Stradivarius&mdash;to old Peleg's grandson! Oh, ye gods!" he muttered.
"Well, I'll be&mdash;" He did not finish his sentence. At another word from
Simeon Holly, David had begun to play.
</P>

<P>
From his seat by the stove Simeon Holly watched his son's face&mdash;and
smiled. He saw amazement, unbelief, and delight struggle for the
mastery; but before the playing had ceased, he was summoned by Perry
Larson to the kitchen on a matter of business. So it was into the
kitchen that John Holly burst a little later, eyes and cheek aflame.
</P>

<P>
"Father, where in Heaven's name DID you get that boy?" he demanded.
"Who taught  him to play like that? I've been trying to find out from
him, but I'd defy Sherlock Holmes himself to make head or tail of the
sort of lingo he talks, about mountain homes and the Orchestra of Life!
Father, what DOES it mean?"
</P>

<P>
Obediently Simeon Holly told the story then, more fully than he had
told it before. He brought forward the letter, too, with its mysterious
signature.
</P>

<P>
"Perhaps you can make it out, son," he laughed. "None of the rest of us
can, though I haven't shown it to anybody now for a long time. I got
discouraged long ago of anybody's ever making it out."
</P>

<P>
"Make it out&mdash;make it out!" cried John Holly excitedly; "I should say I
could! It's a name known the world over. It's the name of one of the
greatest violinists that ever lived."
</P>

<P>
"But how&mdash;what&mdash;how came he in my barn?" demanded Simeon Holly.
</P>

<P>
"Easily guessed, from the letter, and from what the world knows,"
returned John, his voice still shaking with excitement. "He was always
a queer chap, they say, and full of his notions. Six or eight years ago
his wife died. They say he worshiped her, and for weeks refused even to
touch his violin. Then, very suddenly, he, with his four-year-old son,
disappeared&mdash;dropped quite out of sight. Some people guessed the
reason. I knew a man who was well acquainted with him, and at the time
of the disappearance he told me quite a lot about him. He said he was
n't a bit surprised at what had happened. That already half a dozen
relatives were interfering with the way he wanted to bring the boy up,
and that David was in a fair way to be spoiled, even then, with so much
attention and flattery. The father had determined to make a wonderful
artist of his son, and he was known to have said that he believed&mdash;as
do so many others&mdash;that the first dozen years of a child's life are the
making of the man, and that if he could have the boy to himself that
long he would risk the rest. So it seems he carried out his notion
until he was taken sick, and had to quit&mdash;poor chap!"
</P>

<P>
"But why didn't he tell us plainly in that note who he was, then?"
fumed Simeon Holly, in manifest irritation.
</P>

<P>
"He did, he thought," laughed the other. "He signed his name, and he
supposed that was so well known that just to mention it would be
enough. That's why he kept it so secret while he was living on the
mountain, you see, and that's why even David himself didn't know it. Of
course, if anybody found out who he was, that ended his scheme, and he
knew it. So he supposed all he had to do at the last was to sign his
name to that note, and everybody would know who he was, and David would
at once be sent to his own people. (There's an aunt and some cousins, I
believe.) You see he didn't reckon on nobody's being able to READ his
name! Besides, being so ill, he probably wasn't quite sane, anyway."
</P>

<P>
"I see, I see," nodded Simeon Holly, frowning a little. "And of course
if we had made it out, some of us here would have known it, probably.
Now that you call it to mind I think I have heard it myself in days
gone by&mdash;though such names mean little to me. But doubtless somebody
would have known. However, that is all past and gone now."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, yes, and no harm done. He fell into good hands, luckily. You'll
soon see the last of him now, of course."
</P>

<P>
"Last of him? Oh, no, I shall keep David," said Simeon Holly, with
decision.
</P>

<P>
"Keep him! Why, father, you forget who he is! There are friends,
relatives, an adoring public, and a mint of money awaiting that boy.
You can't keep him. You could never have kept him this long if this
little town of yours hadn't been buried in this forgotten valley up
among these hills. You'll have the whole world at your doors the minute
they find out he is here&mdash;hills or no hills! Besides, there are his
people; they have some claim."
</P>

<P>
There was no answer. With a suddenly old, drawn look on his face, the
elder man had turned away.
</P>

<P>
Half an hour later Simeon Holly climbed the stairs to David's room, and
as gently and plainly as he could told the boy of this great, good
thing that had come to him.
</P>

<P>
David was amazed, but overjoyed. That he was found to be the son of a
famous man affected him not at all, only so far as it seemed to set his
father right in other eyes&mdash;in David's own, the man had always been
supreme. But the going away&mdash;the marvelous going away&mdash;filled him with
excited wonder.
</P>

<P>
"You mean, I shall go away and study&mdash;practice&mdash;learn more of my
violin?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, David."
</P>

<P>
"And hear beautiful music like the organ in church, only
more&mdash;bigger&mdash;better?"
</P>

<P>
"I suppose so.".
</P>

<P>
"And know people&mdash;dear people&mdash;who will understand what I say when I
play?"
</P>

<P>
Simeon Holly's face paled a little; still, he knew David had not meant
to make it so hard.
</P>

<P>
"Yes."
</P>

<P>
"Why, it's my 'start'&mdash;just what I was going to have with the
gold-pieces," cried David joyously. Then, uttering a sharp cry of
consternation, he clapped his fingers to his lips.
</P>

<P>
"Your&mdash;what?" asked the man.
</P>

<P>
"N&mdash;nothing, really, Mr. Holly,&mdash;Uncle Simeon,&mdash;n&mdash;nothing."
</P>

<P>
Something, either the boy's agitation, or the luckless mention of the
gold-pieces sent a sudden dismayed suspicion into Simeon Holly's eyes.
</P>

<P>
"Your 'start'?&mdash;the 'gold-pieces'? David, what do you mean?"
</P>

<P>
David shook his head. He did not intend to tell. But gently,
persistently, Simeon Holly questioned until the whole piteous little
tale lay bare before him: the hopes, the house of dreams, the sacrifice.
</P>

<P>
David saw then what it means when a strong man is shaken by an emotion
that has mastered him; and the sight awed and frightened the boy.
</P>

<P>
"Mr. Holly, is it because I'm&mdash;going&mdash;that you care&mdash;so much? I never
thought&mdash;or supposed&mdash;you'd&mdash;CARE," he faltered.
</P>

<P>
There was no answer. Simeon Holly's eyes were turned quite away.

"Uncle Simeon&mdash;PLEASE! I&mdash;I think I don't want to go, anyway. I&mdash;I'm
sure I don't want to go&mdash;and leave YOU!"

Simeon Holly turned then, and spoke.

"Go? Of course you'll go, David. Do you think I'd tie you here to
me&mdash;NOW?" he choked. "What don't I owe to you&mdash;home, son, happiness!
Go?&mdash;of course you'll go. I wonder if you really think I'd let you
stay! Come, we'll go down to mother and tell her. I suspect she'll want
to start in to-night to get your socks all mended up!" And with head
erect and a determined step, Simeon Holly faced the mighty sacrifice in
his turn, and led the way downstairs.

The friends, the relatives, the adoring public, the mint of money&mdash;they
are all David's now. But once each year, man grown though he is, he
picks up his violin and journeys to a little village far up among the
hills. There in a quiet kitchen he plays to an old man and an old
woman; and always to himself he says that he is practicing against the
time when, his violin at his chin and the bow drawn across the strings,
he shall go to meet his father in the far-away land, and tell him of
the beautiful world he has left.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
