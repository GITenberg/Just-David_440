description: "Just David is a 1916 children's novel by Eleanor H. Porter. It was among\
  \ the top six bestsellers in cities across the United States in 1916, and in July\
  \ 1916 it was the second bestselling novel.\nOriginally published by Houghton Mifflin,\
  \ it tells the story of a young boy, David, who must learn to adapt to living with\
  \ others after the death of his recluse father; along the way, the villagers and\
  \ his adoptive parents adapt as much or more to him. Though criticized by reviewers\
  \ as \"mush\" and \"too perfectly lovely,\" the novel was very popular in the early\
  \ half of the twentieth century in middle and high schools, and has recently seen\
  \ a number of reprints. The novel was transcribed in Braille in 1922, and translated\
  \ in Chinese (1959) and Russian (2005).\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
